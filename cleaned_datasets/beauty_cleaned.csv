Is there a body wash or very simple skin care routine someone can recommend that is easy to follow and will help reduce my scarring?   


I dont really have a routine at the moment, I'm quite tall and can't properly reach my back to apply creams. I usually just use a Dove branded body wash that has no sulfates included + shower pouf and then hop out the shower and dry myself with a towel.

Beautiful_Phase7364,"Merzy Academia (mini comparison with Romand and Peripera) - I‚Äôve been eyeing Merzy for sometime, they seem to have many dark shades. Their new Academia collection looks so pretty so I‚Äôve decided to try out. The tints feel similar to Peripera Ink velvet tint, but I don‚Äôt have similar shades so I didn‚Äôt swatch them. The colors are quite similar to the Romand so I added swatches, in case you already have the colors. 

Merzy Mellow tint. Shade AM6 Last chapter &amp; M4 Bian rose
- Cons: Smell like peripera ink velvet tint: chemically floral that goes away after few minutes, but it‚Äôs quite annoying under mask üò∑ Romand milk tea velvet tints looks similar but smell better (chocolate scent) and have thinner consistency.
- Pros: Matte and not drying. It becomes less shiny after a while. It doesn‚Äôt feels drying like the Romand, it feels as comfortable as the Peripera and maybe a bit more matte. 
-&gt; Overall I like it, will buy more shadesüëç If you like the Peripera ink velvet, you will like Merzy mellow tint, they are similar (Peri are good at bright colors, Merzy are good at muted, deep colors). If you want something more matte, check the Romand zero velvet. If scent is important to you or you like sheer colors, check out the Romand milk tea tint.

Cotton lipstick. AL5 dutch tulip
- Pros:
Lightweight and Smudge very little. You can see on the photo how much the tints transfer but not the lipstick.
- Cons:
1/ Can look uneven and reveal imperfections, so I have to prep lips and take more time blending.
2/ Poor quality packaging. It is super light and not sturdy at all. It feels like a $1 lipstick and can be broken if I drop it.
3/ The scent is very very subtle but it‚Äôs waxy, like kid‚Äôs crayon.
-&gt; overall: if you want a smudge-proof lip product, Romand blur fudge tint will be a better choice.",1815,329,asian_beauty

Skin type: Oily/combination, acne-prone. Nightly tretinoin user as treatment for hormonal cystic acne.

SK-II Clear Treatment Lotion: Repurchase (after trying out a mini). this is an absolutely excellent toner. It‚Äôs more affordable than the essence and I find it gives me a comparable glow! Definitely helps with even out my skin tone and boost radiance. Has a very low percentage of salicylic acid but I find that the BHA works overtime here!

Dr. Jart Ceramidin Creme: Repurchase. I adore this moisturizer. My best friend originally brought me a tube from South Korea and I fell in love! It does feel a bit heavy on my skin at times but it‚Äôs deeply moisturizing and always makes my skin feel so soft and bouncy the next morning. Great option for the colder months! For me this is kind of a rescue product. I also really like the packaging- I try to stay away from products that come in tubs just as a matter of personal preference, and this tube-packaging is ideal. Great for travel!

SK-II Pitera Bestseller Trial Kit: Repurchase. I hiiiiighly recommend this set to anyone interested in trying out SK-II products! It comes with 75ml of the essence, a travel size cleanser, mini Skinpower moisturizer and 1 sheet mask. The price on Stylevana is soooo much better than at Sephora and also comes with more product! I‚Äôve grown really fond of the Skinpower moisturizer and the essence is a forever HG.

iUnik Beta Glucan Power Moisture Serum: Repurchase (third time?). I absolutely LOVE this serum. Incredibly soothing, nourishing, hydrating, it‚Äôs just perfect. Probably my all time favorite hydrating serum. This soothes irritation and redness like nothing else I‚Äôve tried. Contains no HA. Just a gorgeous, simple and effective formula. Will always RP this one!

Beauty of Joseon Glow Serum: first time purchase! I‚Äôve gone through bottles of the repair serum and glow deep serum and I really enjoyed both! I was looking for a serum with a higher concentration of niacinamide and this one spoke to me. I‚Äôve loved everything I‚Äôve tried from Beauty of Joseon (the only exception being their sunscreen‚Ä¶ RIP) and I‚Äôm looking forward to using this!

 Missha Time Revolution Red Algae Revitalizing Serum: first time purchase, and kind of a random one? lol, I adore Missha and am currently using the Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule which has a stunning concentration of ferments.

Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum x2: Repurchase and will alwaysss repurchase. This is one of the Sulwhasoo products that genuinely lives up to the hype. It‚Äôs just perfect.

hillary_____k,"Stylevana haul &amp; mini reviews :) - Skin type for reference: Oily/combination, acne-prone, sometimes dehydrated. Nightly tretinoin user as treatment for hormonal cystic acne.

Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water: first time purchase and have not tried yet! I‚Äôve heard great things about this essence and am looking forward to adding it to my routine as an extra layer of hydration this coming winter.

SK-II Clear Treatment Lotion: Repurchase (after trying out a mini). this is an absolutely excellent toner. It‚Äôs more affordable than the essence and I find it gives me a comparable glow! Definitely helps with even out my skin tone and boost radiance. Has a very low percentage of salicylic acid but I find that the BHA works overtime here!

Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner: Repurchase (I‚Äôve gone through 2 bottles of this). I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this toner. Such a simple and beautiful formula. Contains no HA, hydrates generously and has a super lightweight watery texture. It just makes me happy!

Dr. Jart Ceramidin Creme: Repurchase. I adore this moisturizer. My best friend originally brought me a tube from South Korea and I fell in love! It does feel a bit heavy on my skin at times but it‚Äôs deeply moisturizing and always makes my skin feel so soft and bouncy the next morning. Great option for the colder months! For me this is kind of a rescue product. I also really like the packaging- I try to stay away from products that come in tubs just as a matter of personal preference, and this tube-packaging is ideal. Great for travel!

SK-II Pitera Bestseller Trial Kit: Repurchase. I hiiiiighly recommend this set to anyone interested in trying out SK-II products! It comes with 75ml of the essence, a travel size cleanser, mini Skinpower moisturizer and 1 sheet mask. The price on Stylevana is soooo much better than at Sephora and also comes with more product! I‚Äôve grown really fond of the Skinpower moisturizer and the essence is a forever HG.

iUnik Beta Glucan Power Moisture Serum: Repurchase (third time?). I absolutely LOVE this serum. Incredibly soothing, nourishing, hydrating, it‚Äôs just perfect. Probably my all time favorite hydrating serum. This soothes irritation and redness like nothing else I‚Äôve tried. Contains no HA. Just a gorgeous, simple and effective formula. Will always RP this one!

Beauty of Joseon Glow Serum: first time purchase! I‚Äôve gone through bottles of the repair serum and glow deep serum and I really enjoyed both! I was looking for a serum with a higher concentration of niacinamide and this one spoke to me. I‚Äôve loved everything I‚Äôve tried from Beauty of Joseon (the only exception being their sunscreen‚Ä¶ RIP) and I‚Äôm looking forward to using this!

 Missha Time Revolution Red Algae Revitalizing Serum: first time purchase, and kind of a random one? lol, I adore Missha and am currently using the Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule which has a stunning concentration of ferments. This serum just caught my eye and I thought I‚Äôd give it a try! Red algae is a beautiful antioxidant. If anyone has tried this or anything else from this line, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts :) Looking forward to giving this a go!

Sunscreens:

Biore UV Watery Essence x2: Repurchase. Have used up countless tubes of this. HG sunscreen. Chef‚Äôs kiss.

Kose Suncut UV Perfect Gel: first time purchase! Looking forward to trying this one :)

Nivea UV Super Water Gel: Repurchase. I adore this sunscreen. Truly feels like water, absorbs effortlessly, just perfect. No eye stinging!

Skin Aqua Super Moisture Gel: Surprisingly the first time I‚Äôve ever purchased this, but I‚Äôm reeeeeally enjoying it so far! Blends in so beautifully, no pilling whatsoever, reapplication  is flawless. Does tend to make me look a bit shiny after a few hours of wear but nothing that a bit of translucent powder can‚Äôt fix! I also sometimes use a non-AB mattifying primer that is SPF 50 to reapply over sunscreens that are on the shinier side.

Missha Essence Sun: first time purchase! I‚Äôve heard great things, looking forward to trying after I finish up my currently opened SPFs.

Missha Essence Sun Milk Ex: Repurchase. I looooove this sunscreen so much. This was actually the first AB sunscreen I ever tried and I‚Äôve never looked back! It‚Äôs interesting that it now includes ‚ÄúEx‚Äù in the name- I know that Missha reformulates often, so I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs the reason for the name change.

Products purchased:

Cur√©l intensive moisture care : moisture gel-lotion
DeLuxe: Fra√Æche Beaut√©
Botanical hot cleansing gel
Rosette cleansing paste : Kaidei smooth 
Bior√© pore pack
Clayge care &amp; spa : shampoo and treatment 

Reviews:

So far, I have only tried the Rosette cleansing paste, and the Clayge shampoo and conditioner

For the cleansing paste, I am really not a fan. It has a very strong smell, and I don‚Äôt feel like it really does anything for my skin. It does remove makeup pretty decently, but I wouldn‚Äôt repurchase.

For the Clayge shampoo and conditioner: since arriving in Japan, my hair has been unmanageably greasy. To the point where I would wash and dry my hair, and it would dry looking wet. I had never had this problem before, and was at a loss. This shampoo has saved my hair. While it doesn‚Äôt smell the greatest, I can go up to 3 days in between washing if I really need to, and my hair will look great until I wash it.",1213,222,asian_beauty

Top (wrist side) is Hera and bottom is Peripera. They are both velvety matte liquid formula. Peripera has a very slight tint of red compared to Hera, but this difference should be minuscule when actually on the lips.

Peripera is much cheaper, although you have to get it from Korea vs. the Hera which is sold on Amazon Prime. I paid $27.74 for Hera (5g) on Amazon and $9.36 for Peripera (4g) on Olive Young Global before tax and shipping.

Given the large price difference, I say go for Peripera if this fall lip color is to your liking (but if you can wait for the shipping.)",862,160,asian_beauty
Excellent-Jello,"Help! Eyebrow Waxing Gone Wrong -  

*Processing video ko81y12i7sp91...*

Skin type: Normal but sometimes a bit dry

Skin concern: How do I heal this scar?

Three weeks ago, I got my eyebrows waxed from the same lady at the same salon that I've been going to for the last two years. I didn't do anything differently for the last two years and I always got exactly what I wanted but on that day, my worst nightmare became a reality‚Ä¶

Ten minutes after leaving the salon, I got into my car and noticed some pink marks on my skin between my eyebrows and under my left eyebrow. I called the salon and spoke to the lady who said that it was normal after an eyebrow wax (clearly not if this is my first time in two years) and instructed me to apply aloe vera on it (or moisturiser because I didn't have any on hand).

Off to the pharmacist I went to buy some 100% pure aloe vera and I applied it regularly for the next two days. Nothing improved. In fact, it actually got worse! It was inflamed, stinging and angry. I was beside myself because I was so frightened that this would lead to permanent scarring literally this time next year for my wedding (30/09/23). I called my hair and makeup artist because I remembered she used to work in a skincare clinic. She recommended that I use DMK Beta Gel and Actrol Powder (hence the white border around the scabs).

In the next few days, I began to scab which was a clear sign that my skin was healing itself and over time, the scabs fell off on their own leaving a vulnerable layer of pink baby skin. This is where I'm at now. I'm grateful that my skin is no longer an open wound but I'm disappointed that the pinkness is taking forever to fade away. I am using all the products my makeup artist is recommending, all DMK products (Melanotech drops and cr√®me, Solar Gel, Herbal Pigment Oil), and even doing DMK enzyme therapy and LED red light therapy, but just frustrated by the slow progress.

I guess I'm doing everything I can under the sun (except for being under the sun) right now. I haven't been working for the last three weeks because I'm afraid of going out in the sun and people staring at my scar. As a casual worker, this has taken an emotional, physical and financial toll on me. I just want to know if anyone's experienced something like this before and can you please share with me your stories of how you managed this.",2375,443,asian_beauty

I bought this as a set from Amazon, it was 46$ and the best price I found online. The smell isn‚Äôt the best but it‚Äôs environmentally conscious. It didn‚Äôt do much for my dryness but it makes my hair feel soft and gives it volume. (I use a home rosemary oil made from coconut oil and rosemary to help with dryness.)The Scalp Scrub is easy to use. It feels refreshing and cool. I‚Äôll be reordering.

Order date August 5, 2022
Shipping date August 11, 2022
Deliver date August 29, 2022
I got expedited shipping and all my products had a 24 hour shipping estimate.

-Elizavecca - Milky Piggy Collagen Coating Protein Ion Injection- I was super excited for this and it definitely lived up to my expectations. It smelled great and it made my hair feel silky. My only issue is the container is small but I feel like you need a lot to really use it. 10/10

-innisfree - My Perfumed Body Body Cleanser- I got the Grapefruit scent, it smelled amazing and I could smell it all over my house for a while. A little goes a long way for this one however the scent disappears quickly. For me, someone who bathes at night the scent was gone by morning. I also noticed break outs on my body around the time I started using it possibly from the amount of fragrance but that could also be for different reasons. 6/10

-SOME BY MI - AHA-BHA-PHA 30 Days Miracle Acne Clear Foam- I think it lives up to the name ‚Äò30 Day Miracle‚Äô it‚Äôs a chemical exfoliator and a foam so a little goes a long way. It smells like tea tree and mint and feels cool on the skin 10/10

-COSRX - BHA Blackhead Power Liquid 100ml- I‚Äôve noticed results quickly but I feel like you have to be super consistent or they‚Äôll come back. 7/10

-Axis-Y - Spot The Difference Blemish Treatment- With consistent use I noticed decent results. 8/10


-LANEIGE - Cica Sleeping Mask SAMPLE- A little also goes a long way for this. It was very hydrating I would buy a full size. 9/10

I started using the Laneige sleeping mask on Wednesday. On Thursday night, I used the Innisfree clay mask, left it on for 15 minutes then rinse it off, my skin felt a bit tight. On Friday morning I noticed some whiteheads on my face and my skin was kinda red, no irritation tho. I thought those whiteheads were caused by eating too much instant noodles (I have been eating noodles for 3 days so far). But I'm doubting that one of these two is the real reason that triggers allergic reactions. 

I had used the Laneige sleeping mask before as Sephora birthday gift without any problems. I have been using the Innisfree clay mask for a month without any problems too. I'm just confused, is there any way to figure out which one is giving me allergy?? I don't want to give then away just yet.",928,175,asian_beauty

My first AB haul (and a gift from SK-II, still unopened). Selected these items based on HG posts over the past few months.

My routine:
AM
1. ROVECTIN Skin Essentials 
2. Missha Time Revolution Artemisia Essence
3. HaruHaru Black Rice Toner
4. Numbuz:n Serum 3
5. ILLIYOON Soothing Gel

* still searching for my sunscreen favorite (just order Biore Water/Blue Bottle)

PM
1. PYUNKANG YUL Deep Clear Cleansing Balm
Then 1-4 as above/PM #2-5
6. COSRX Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence
7. ILLIYOON Ato Concentrate Cream

I LOVE every product above. Just placed an order for another BOJ Glow Serum (I VERY lovingly, gave it to my sister) and the Neogen Exfoliating pads (Green). I had received them as a sample and I really liked them for a gentle exfoliant 2x a week.

Also, since I am a product junkie‚Ä¶I placed duplicates of everything for when I run out, in addition to the MISSHA Night Ampoule and the Illiyoon intensive cream for neck &amp; chest at night! 

I would highly recommend every product posted here, so much so that I haven‚Äôt even opened the SK-II box my awesome hubs bought as a gift when I kept telling him about all the dupes I was researching/ordering and he didn‚Äôt understand why I wasn‚Äôt ordering the original?! (It was a surprise and I cried when it arrived?!) I am trying g to replenish my skin and will see if the SKII products can ‚Äúbring it up a level‚Äù when I fee I‚Äôve reached a good baseline!

excuse-me-ily,"Kyurin Diary - Can we talk about Asian beauty content creator Kyurin Diary? I've seen her short videos against my own will on various platforms. I don't know if I'm bitter, but I think a lot of her content is strange.

I'd like to point out that I am Southeast Asian. What irks me about her content is that it's centered on why or how East Asians in particular have perfect makeup/skin/hair/etc.

As many of you know, pale/light skin is the beauty standard across Asia (East, Southeast, and South.) Majority of East Asians are pale/light skinned while Southeast and South have always had a market for whitening products. We have been taught that our features (tan skin, etc) is not desirable. (Sorry if this part isn't relevant but I feel like it is.) I'm also aware that East Asia has a big market for whitening products too. 

I feel like all of Asia should be celebrated, not just East Asians. Southeast and South Asia are already so underrepresented that it feels unfair in my eyes for her to make it even more so. I just don't like how she doesn't include other Asians in her videos. Why only East Asians? It makes me feel like East Asians are what Asians should look like. Non Asian people already expect this; I hate hearing ""you're Asian? but you don't look Asian."" it just hurts.

For example, the YouTube Short video of hers I linked is titled ""How Do East Asians get GORGEOUS PONYTAIL."" The kicker is that she uses Lisa of Blackpink as an example; and Lisa is southeast Asian. Tell me I'm not the only one who thinks that's strange? 

I wouldn't have a problem if her videos were titled ""How to get a gorgeous ponytail."" It just feels very exclusive..",1662,300,asian_beauty

It seems like the Colorgram is an amazing dupe for the Fenty contour stick. If I were to analyze, it seems only slightly cooler or sheerer? It slides on much more smoothly than the Fenty stick which is stiffer (and probably a bit dried out due to its age).

iggy_y,"Recent Kbeauty haul (Jung Beauty and Lavien Cosmetics) - My very recent Kbeauty haul with majority from Lavien Cosmetics.

Jung Beauty (Ksisters brand):
- 7 SECOND INSTANT NOURISH WATER TREATMENT (purchased 4)
I really like this and it has helped to reduce the itch on my scalp giving it a nice cooling sensation while making my hair feel incredibly soft with my scalp not being as oily. Living in a tropical humid country (average temperature being in the 30s celsius and humidity &gt; 80%) I love anything that gives a cooling sensation and has salicylic acid.

Lavien Cosmetics:
- 2 Firming Lift Eye Cream (Have not try yet)

- Radiance Bio Cellulose Mask (Have not try yet). I got it as a gift when I bought the eye cream.

- Radiance Essence Cushion in Shade 23 Medium Beige (Have not try yet).
I love their Derma Radiance BB cream (1 shade) so i‚Äôm definitely looking forward to this. Shade 23 is more yellow based so hopefully it looks alright on me as shade 21 is more pink and slightly fairer. I was surprised that I received this compact design but also happy as I much prefer this over their usual one. 

- CENTELLA CREAMING Toner and Refill. Love this and have tried the mini that I was gifted by Ksisters and I love it so much that I repurchased during their recent sale. Hydrating while exfoliating (contains PHA AHA BHA AKA)

- Perfect Radiance Tone Up. Tried on hand and it feels very hydrating, moist and nice while giving a slight tone up and is pink based. It also has a floral fragrance.

Definitely a pricey brand if I purchase RTP or from Ksisters but the official Korean website does amazing sales every month so items that usually cost  e.g., SGD 40-50 can end up being SGD 20-30 if I purchase the biggest bundle. However, I have to use a shipping forwarding service in order to ship it over.",1815,329,asian_beauty

JainJari,"Kurti ‚Äì Trendy Women‚Äôs Clothing - When  you think of the type of kurtis that are trending right now the   first  name that comes to your mind is that of the ethnic-style ones. As   the  name of these products would indicate, these products resemble the    ethnic dresses of India in terms of appearance. This is a relatively   new  style when you come to think of it and as such it has been trending   in  the past couple of years.

**Floor-length kurtis**

These   are also being referred to as maxi kurtis in certain circles.    Fashionable, trendy and literally regal in its entirety, these kurtis    are reigning ethnic fashion today.

The   thing with these kurtis is that they go down till your ankles. At  the   top they are form-fitted, and at the bottom they are flowing and   loose  just like a skirt. Now, it is up to you to decide if you want to   wear  leggings underneath this or not. This is because of the   considerable  length of these dresses. This is why there is a good  chance  that the  leggings would hardly show. One of the best things  about these  **kurtis** is the ease with which you can carry them around.¬†

All you have to do is pair them with equally trendy accessories and you should be good to go.

**Asymmetrical kurtis**

Their   length is not the same when looked at from all sides- a feature  that   renders a touch of exclusivity to these dresses. In most cases  they do   not have any slit in the sides as well. The two major variants  of  these  dresses are the tail kurtis and the high-low kurtis. They would   look  really well when you pair them with leggings that match. Yet   another  advantage of these dresses is that they look rather   sophisticated and  smart. This is the reason why they would be just as   suitable on formal  occasions as they would in case of the semi-formal   ones.¬†

As such, it has been highly popular especially since 2020.¬†

**Layered kurtis**

A   lot of women love these so much that they have developed a crush  over   the same. As their names would indicate, they have a couple of  layers   in them. Now, there are a couple of variations of these dresses.  In  the  first one you would get a plain kurta underneath with a designed    jacket on the front that stays all open as well. In the other one you    just have an extra layer underneath the hemline. This creates a    double-layered look when in actuality there is none.¬†

**Front-slit kurtis**

These   are basically plain kurtis with a bit of twist thrown in for  good   measure. They come with a front split despite having a couple of  normal   slits on either side. They look really well with the likes of  jeans,   pants, and palazzos. This is one of the latest designs doing the  round   these days and you can easily wear them to the parties.",2784,489,asian_beauty

  Summer! The first thing that comes after hearing this word ( summer) is sweat, tanning, pimples, acne, and dull skin due to extremely hot weather. And you also have to take care of your skin in this condition and also have to attend college and office meetings with a glowing face and internal confidence level hitting the sky.  
¬†Just stick with us we will resolve this issue for you. In summers the most basic issue is using heavy makeup and using heavy skincare products due to the fact that‚Äù summers have come and glow is about to go‚Äù. Uh! It's not true at all you can still take care of your skin and maintain healthy glowing skin in the summers Here in this article, we will discuss some basic easy steps to make your skin glow. Let's get into it ,¬†

## STEP 1.¬†

## ¬†Cleansing¬†

üì∑  
¬†Cleaning your skin with a proper cleanser is a need not only for summers but also throughout the whole year. Keeping your skin dirty and not cleansing it properly can cause an accumulation of oil and bacteria in your skin which eventually leads to black or whiteheads then ultimately into acne.so, use a light foaming cleanser replacing it with heavy cleansers you used in winters.¬†  


### ¬†TIP:

### "" Your skin care products must be as light as your wardrobe becomes in summers as it also needs some rest from that heavy makeup and chemical you used in winters. Avoid oily and leathery face wash and cleanser just use a mild foaming cleanser instead. ""

## ¬†STEP 2.

## Vitamin-C serum or multivitamin¬†....

rczc,"Let's Talk Fullerenes - Regarding the below: I am not a cosmetic chemist. If you want to read what a cosmetic chemist has to say about this as a skincare ingredient (because honestly, *why* *wouldn‚Äôt you want to)*, [Labmuffin](https://labmuffin.com/fullerenes-in-skincare-juva-review/) wrote a brief (for her) intro about it in 2018 as part of a sponsored ad. The sub also had a [discussion about it 5 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5p2hmv/lets_talk_about_the_ingredient_fullerene) but seems to have mostly disappeared from the sub since. I‚Äôm sharing what I've looked into about it ~~and because I came across this while looking for an excuse to buy sunscreen I didn‚Äôt need~~. **Does anyone have any positive, negative, mediocre experiences with fullerene products they want to share?**

[Credit: Vectorstock](https://preview.redd.it/ddysk5byzkt81.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f49ede3db154eb91c8801c7cdb2f1baf3419865)

&amp;#x200B;

The [Nobel Peace Prize in Chemistry](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1996/press-release) was awarded to three professors in 1996 for their discovery of fullerenes. This carbon structure was discovered in 1985 and can vary in how many carbon atoms are in a cell. Clusters of 60 carbon atoms (C60) are slow-reacting compounds that are highly stable and are known as buckminsterfullerene or ‚Äúbuckyball‚Äù (fun super fact: apparently they are able to [bounce back into shape](https://www.instructables.com/Construct-a-Buckyball-Fullerene) after smashing it against the wall nearly at the speed of light).

Research of their use in skincare is still understandably still sparse but thus far there seems to be a lot of positive:

&gt;it is known to act as a ‚Äúradical sponge‚Äù or antioxidant because of its 30 carbon double bonds to which multiple radicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), can easily be added.[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/exd.13172#exd13172-bib-0005), [6](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/exd.13172#exd13172-bib-0006) Importantly, fullerenes do not become a self-reactive free radical during this process unlike most other antioxidants, including Œ±-tocopherol and ascorbic acid, making them one of the most potent radical scavengers. [Source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/exd.13172)

* As an antioxidant, it is at least [100x more effective than other antioxidants like vitamin c](https://www.vc60.com/en/tech/effect/antioxidant.html) and when cells were exposed to UV light, they lived longer when fullerene was added compared to Vitamin C and Vitamin E. Also unlike Vitamin C or Vitamin E, fullerene‚Äôs effectiveness increases when cells are [exposed to more fullerene](https://www.vc60.com/en/tech/effect/continuation.html).
* So far is has shown to have positively [treated acne](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20887812/) by inhibiting sebum production and increasing skin‚Äôs hydration.
* Helps with the [recovery of skin barrier](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23815352/).
* Was found to have [reduced pore size by 17.6%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24559044/) in a small sample size of 10 women given a 1% fullerene lotion for 8 weeks.
* Wrinkle repair [in mice](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/srt.12903) and wrinkle [minimization](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21137794/) in a small human study.
* Improves the function of [titanium dioxide sunscreens](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24734542/). (From what I can gather it‚Äôs caused by the fullerene acting as an antioxidant against the free radical damages of titanium dioxide. If someone understands this better, *please share*).
* Increased hair growth [in mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19223242/).

Safe for [human skin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19797864/), though irritating to get into the eye. Do not ingest [if you are a small lab animal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685830/). [Seriously](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22467026/). A lot of the potential concerns for fullerene seems to come from ingesting, so even though there may have been some studies regarding [rats and EVOO](https://www.anti-agingfirewalls.com/2014/02/25/update-on-c60-fullerenes-in-olive-oil/), do not.",4268,500,asian_beauty

JoyJoey,"Singapore brand- Allies Of Skin'sMolecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser - I've bought this once. And im still not done with the first tube yet. This is my review:

 It gently  removes dirt, grime, and make-up without stripping the skin.  This is an impressively luxurious cleanser that lives up to the hype. It has an enjoyable jelly-type texture that feels gentle on the skin. I could use this morning and night (as a second cleanse) with no issues. It paired perfectly with the deviant skincare cleansing concentrate, my holy grail first cleanse that I reviewed . I felt like my skin looked balanced and clean when I used it, and I actually cut it open to squeeze out the last bit of product.  

Overall, it suits my yellow Asian skin type a lot.

Age: Early 20s

Skin Type: Normal-Dry, get dehydrated easily

Skin Concerns: Hyper pigmentation, texture,  reducing pigmentation from past acne

Review:

I was concerned this was gonna be too heavy, because one of my friends said it made her skin a little oily but my intuition said to buy it. I absolutely love this product, I've only used it for about a week but my skin feels so much softer and my texture has improved dramatically. It's not heavy at all and feels great on the skin. I love the smell; a lot of reviews said it smelled too much like sake; however I grew up with a sake drinking granddad and I don't think it smells like sake; if anything it has a light sweet flowery smell? Anyways, I really enjoy this product. I will write an update review as I continue using it. I also have their sake cream and I am undecided on whether I like it or not yet; I will update on the cream as I continue using it.",968,182,asian_beauty

I'm more concerned about finding something with as similar of an ingredient list as possible, so that i don't break out. Also, preferably just as light (not heavy ones, please!). From looking at the ingredients list, i guess my skin seems to like whatever silicones there are in the iunik formula?

Examples of things I tried that have broken me out badly in the past: neutrogena hydroboost, cerave PM, cerave in the tub, Aveeno eczema care. So definitely no to those!

captainSmileyWhale,"Thought for skin fasting? - Has anyone read the book about skin fasting written by Dr. Ryuichi Utsugi (a Japanese skin specialist). (Only available in Japanese, Chinese and Korean tho) I‚Äôve heard of the term ‚Äòskin fasting‚Äô trending for a few years but only got my hands on the books a couple weeks ago. He noticed among his clients, the ones who are the most dedicated about applying skincare products are the ones getting the worst skin condition over time. He suggested to ditch all the products, only use water and pure soap and maybe vaseline for the skin. I‚Äôve been using skincare products for decades since teenagers and in the last couple years, I noticed that no matter how moisturized the products are supposed to be, when i applied them, my skin still feels dry and dehydrated underneath with a top coat of stuff. Age is a factor as well, but still. Wondering if anyone has tried that approach?",904,160,asian_beauty

Yuwapa,"Review : Laneige lip sleeping mask 5/5 - I received a lot of recommendations regarding this product and I decided to try it out. The lip texture has a light scent, not too pungent. The texture is just right, not too sticky, throughout my 1 month of use I think this lip sleeping mask is perfect for people who suffer from frequent flaky lips as it is very moisturizing. It is recommended that you nourish this before going to bed. Apply to thick lips. And from waking up, you will see that our lips the mouth is softer. More hydrated Not peel I tried wiping my lips with a towel soaked in hot water, the dead skin was immediately wiped off, revealing smoother lips. After using it for a long time, I think my lips are pinker. And I have been doing some trials before the next day. I just discovered that it is very good. It gives our lips a matte finish that is not flaky and moisturized all the time. I think this lip is very good for people who have problems with me. In 1 jar can be used for several months but the disadvantage of it is This lip is not for people who don't like the stickiness on the lips. Some people may use a flaky mouth and a dry mouth as before. So, you can try yourself if it's right for you or not. But I think this product helps to cure dry mouth. My mouth is flaky well. I would like to convince everyone to give it a try.

Antonis_8,"[Discussion] Thoughts on the Purito 90% HA serum? - Hyaluronic acid is already a product that has massive water retaining properties, is there even any benefit in using concentrations such as 90%, when most manufacturers use up to 2%? 

Additonally ascorbic acid (Vit C) is only the 15th ingredient so the concentration is below 1% (10% /14), well below the 5-20% reccomendation.

Same story with Niancinamide being the 5th ingredient, so the concentration is (10%/4) giving an upper boundary of 2.5% which realistically would be even lower, not meeting the 4-5% reccommendation.

In combination with using low volumes due to the high HA conc, the other active's benefits should be nil. 

Of course its a supplementary serum but imo it shouldnt be advertised as much more than a humectant.

Ingredients: 

**Sodium Hyaluronate liquid (90%)**, Glycerin, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Niacinamide**, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Tuber Magnatum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Sodium Polyacrylate, Adenosine (improves wrinkles), Disodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate (antioxidants), **Ascorbic Acid (pure Vitamin C)**, Lactobacillus/Kelp Ferment Filtrate, Chlorella Ferment",1207,174,asian_beauty

Kawai_M,"[DISCUSSION] Do you believe/think shaving your face is good or bad? Is it actually beneficial or detrimental? - Hey everyone I want to hear your guys opinion on shaving your face! I personally do shave my face and love it! But, I wonder what your take on it is and is truly beneficial or actually doing the opposite for your skin? Thank you so much! Can‚Äôt wait to hear your guys thoughts!

Also these are the products I use! 


‚Ä¢ I use a straight razor from EZ Blade. The reason why I prefer a straight razor is the closer shave and also I got into shaving my face because of the Japanese Kao Sori  (È°î„Åù„Çä) or face shaving and all of them use straight razors!

‚ÄºÔ∏èCAUTION‚ÄºÔ∏èIf you are going to use a straight razor please be very carefully! They are way sharper than an eyebrow razor and will defiantly cut you if you aren‚Äôt holding the blade right! You should also utilize proper sanitization! If you are going do use a straight razor it is recommend to always switch the blade out after 1 use! ALSO always take your time preforming this to ensure safety!

‚Ä¢ As for a gel (so it doesn‚Äôt cause friction) I use either: 

***CHIDORIYA SHAVING BAR (Japanese brand similar to TATCHA. Uses secrets from geishas)

***COCONUT OIL  ü•• 

***ALOE VERA GEL (I‚Äôve used many, but I know a lot of people love the nature republic one!)

I use EZ Blade after shave spray as well! (Helps preventing ingrowns)

‚ùïAFTER CARE‚ùï (Right after you shave your face)

When you are done shaving your face only use products that are hydrating and soothing! I also spray on EZ Blade after shave so I don‚Äôt get ingrowns! Don‚Äôt use anything that will strip your skin or be to harsh! Also if possible please use clean products or at least fragrance free! And if you are doing this in the morning please, please, please put on sunscreen! You just opened a fresh layer of skin and you need to protect it! Also refrain from constantly touching your face and if possible use clean pillow cases and sheets. For me it really depends, but I usually just put a adequate amount of rosehip oil and I‚Äôm set!

‚ùïEXTRA TIPS‚ùï

EZ Blade also has some products for it but I have yet to try it! 

A steamer really helps as well with the whole process! Opening the pores makes the whole process run smoother!

If you are worried about acne or razor bumps please never shave your face dry!!! Always make sure your face has some slip to it! However if your confident that your skin will be fine with out the slip you definitely can shave your face dry! 

Also for me personally I don‚Äôt keep the same blade on my straight razor! I switch out the blade for every use! This for me is the best sanitation their is and the blades themselves aren‚Äôt expensive. If you want and in depth review on my products and straight razor I can definitely do that! I can also show you how to ensemble it!

ajkbeauty,"[Review]: Solved Skincare Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner - Solved Skincare Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner

The third product in my routine from Solved Skincare is one that I incorporated a couple of weeks after their Coconut Oil Cleansing Pads and Coconut Water Cleansing Foam.

This hydrating toner features 75% Coconut Water alongside Hibiscus Flower Extract and Rosehip Leaf Extract. Centella Asiatica Extract makes it on the list as well with some basic hydrators and preservatives. 

Just like the other products from Solved Skincare‚Ä¶the ingredients list is really short and keeps things like essential oils and fragrance out of the formulation. I‚Äôve become so impressed with K-Beauty ‚Äúclean‚Äù skincare in its ability to be just as effective and aesthetically pleasing without some of the potentially harsh additives.

Visually, this toner is sunning LOL! From the natural red/orange hue from the hibiscus to the actual hibiscus petals in the bottle‚Ä¶this product just looks so elegant and appealing. 

As far as performance‚Ä¶I have been equally as impressed. The thin/watery fluid applies/pats in really easily and absorbs without any sticky residue. Once on, the amount of intense hydration and mild nourishing is actually kind of shocking considering the short ingredients list.

There is no Sodium Hyaluronate here‚Ä¶.but somehow the Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner provides a deeply hydrating/dewy result that almost feels like a light serum.

A slight honey/herbal scent is apparent which again is surprising since there is no honey or propolis in the formula. It honestly smells like a cup of honey/hibiscus tea and its one of the better smelling products I have used in a while (again without any added fragrance).

Over time, my skin seemed to stay hydrated for longer throughout the day and the glow this toner provides is pretty long lasting as well. I typically like to do several ‚Äúskins‚Äù or layers of toner both in the am and pm‚Ä¶but I found myself only needed 1-2 layers of this product per application. It just seems to offer a lot more than other ‚Äúbasic‚Äù hydrating toners. 

I found myself going through less of this toner than I expected as my skin didn‚Äôt need as much. So, this product is a relatively good value compared to similar products. I could see this bottle lasting me about 3 months. 

Although I have a lot of hydrating toners to get through in my stash‚Ä¶this is one that I will have on my short list of favorites for the year. With its approachable/sensitive skin friendly formula, ease of absorption, and deep hydration‚Ä¶this is a product that I think any skin type would get along with and see benefit from. 

The Solved Skincare brand in general has been quite amazing overall. Each simplistic yet powerful product has impressed me and left me wanting more. The Coconut Oil Cleansing Pads are hands down my favorite of the line (and something I plan on making my forever first step cleanser as soon as I clean out my stash) but I honestly think you can‚Äôt go wrong with picking up any of their offerings. 

I hope to see more of this style of skincare from Korea and elsewhere!

throwaway-786786,"Reviews from someone with sensitive skin for recently purchased Missha All Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel SPF50+/PA++++, Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion Moist, and I'm from Fig Cleansing Balm, and Innisfree My Makeup Cleanser melting balm - **Missha All Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel SPF50+/PA++++**

I had purchased this sunscreen after I felt I needed something with stronger sun protection than my beloved Biore Watery Essence sunscreen, since I had a recent breakout that left a lot of hyperpigmentation.

My main issues with sunscreen have been breakouts. The Biore watery essence had been the only sunscreen I had used that hadn't broken me out. I sometimes doubt the efficacy of the product though, even though it does state spf 50 :/ 

Due to my extensive hyperpigmentation, I was willing to take a risk on trying a new sunscreen, and I'm so glad I did! I looked up the Missha Aqua Sun gel on cosdna and it looked like it didn't have any of the clogging ingredients that I try to avoid, so I bought it. 

I LOVE the Missha All Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel!! It feels and looks higher quality than the Biore sunscreen. It does leave a white cast that, on my darker skin, was unnoticeable by 10-15 minutes after application. After just a couple days of application, I noticed my actual complexion seemed a lot brighter and my spots were lighter, as well. I have been using Alpha Arbutin as well, so it could be that, but I didn't notice it doing much until after starting use of this sunscreen. 

It is a bit drying, because of the alcohol in it, but I have very oily skin, so this is actually a plus for me. 

And best of all - it does not break me out!! So happy with this purchase. 

**Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion Moist**

I had been wanting to add some more hydration to my routine and noticed that this product had gotten many good reviews and it didn't appear to have any clogging ingredients based on cosdna. 

Unfortunately, upon the second application, I started getting horrible, inflamed cysts. I don't usually get cysts unless I have a bad reaction to a product, and this had been the only new product I started that week. 

I tried using it on my arms and legs after a shower (since HA needs moisture), and while it doesn't break me out there, it's not as hydrating as other products I've tried in the past. 

I will not be repurchasing and will likely have to throw the whole bottle out. 

**I'm from Fig Cleansing Balm**

My Holy Grail cleansing balm that I'd been using since 2017, the Grain Ferment Cleansing Sherbet, has been discontinued. I can't find it on Amazon except from shady sellers, so I knew I had to find a new one.

I came across I'm from Fig Cleansing Balm from one of James Welsh's videos. It appeared to be very similar to the cleansing sherbet, so I looked it up and it had the same non-clogging makeup remover ingredient, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, that the cleansing sherbet had.

I did a quick cosdna check of this cleansing balm and it passed so I purchased. 

I LOVE THIS MAKEUP REMOVER!!! It's super effective, smells great, and I think I like it even more than the cleansing sherbet. It does not break me out, and I've noticed my skin has improved since starting using this. 

**Innisfree My Makeup Cleanser melting balm**

This also uses cetyl ethylhexanoate, but feels less effective. It felt like it was being absorbed into my skin, which is a NO-NO for me, as I have extremely clog-prone skin. It's the reason I avoid oils in my makeup removing products, because every product with oil I've tried has broken me out. The melting balm does have some oil in it, but I'm not sure if it's the culprit, since the fig cleansing balm also has morula oil in it. But I did wake up with small little pink spots after one night of use. Will not be repurchasing. 

It feels less high-quality than the I'm from Fig cleansing balm, so I will be purchasing that instead from now on. 

Hope this helps! Send me any questions you have :)",3979,714,asian_beauty

LAlady1212,"Daycell Dr Vita Masks - Maneki Neko in LA's Little Tokyo has had Dr Vita's Vita A and Vita B masks on deep discount for awhile now-- 2 boxes of 10 for $9.99 (buy one, get one free). NOT expired lol, I checked! Anyway, I've hesitated because I couldn't find a review anywhere, but I finally picked some up the other day and thought I'd put something up, though I'm not much of a reviewer, just in case anyone else finds themselves with the same dilemma.

The short review is: these masks are actually pretty great. They have that combination of high-quality cotton and lots of essence that makes for masks that almost disappear when you put them on, so you look like a ghost, or an uncanny-valley-digital-animation character. Nothing paper-y about these guys. The fit is also great-- for me. I am a tall lady with a pretty big face, and a lot of the Japanese masks are impossibly small on me. But these ones are perfect. I don't have to alter the eye cutouts, and they cover my entire face. 

I tried the Vita A (Anti-Wrinkle and Firming) and the Vita B (Aqua Calming). (This line also includes a Vita C and Vita E option, but they weren't available.) I didn't notice a ton of difference between the Vita A and Vita C, which for me was good. I was anxious about the Vita A, because I'm careful with my anti-aging actives, and have a pretty good routine that I don't like to mess with. I really only want masks for moisturizing. But the whole first half of the ingredients list on the Vita A mask was all moisturizing, with really just a little retinyl palmate to distinguish it from the Vita B (which has niacinimide instead). BOTH have hyaluronic acid, snail secretion, and camellia leaf extract-- all of which I love-- and a few other moisturizing ingredients besides. Both were really moisturizing. The Vita B mask I left on for almost an hour, and could have gone for longer if I had more time.

Anyway, I see that these can run up to $5 a piece ordered online, and I'm not sure they're worth that (for me that's like a special occasion mask), but they are quite nice, and quite moisturizing. Certainly better than ANY mask that I've ever gotten for under a dollar a piece-- downright LUXURIOUS compared to my usual every-day-masks. I will definitely be stocking up. And it's made me curious enough about the Vita E mask that I might even be willing to order a couple at the higher price point.",2397,438,asian_beauty

Khmerwarrior,"Is it true that Southeast Asian women(Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, etc) are much less obsessed with being very skinny compared to women from first world countries? - As far as I know, being skinny as a stick is seen as largely unattractive for many people Southeast  Asian countries. I will talk about Cambodia. To be rail thin (SE ASIAN) is not a  ‚Äúbeautiful thing for women‚Äù, people mostly would look down at you and mock you if  you‚Äôre way too skinny, they mostly prefer thick body or slim with curve (but  not flat). It‚Äôs not about how developed is the country, that will affect  daily lifestyle and so on. Furthermore, it is not that Southeast Asian women don‚Äôt care about their  weight, it‚Äôs just that certain women from first world countries are too obsessed with being very  skinny.  What I am kind of right about is that it's much less common for women in  poorer countries to be concerned about body image as its more of a  ‚Äúfirst world problem‚Äù and virtually all southeast Asian countries (with  the exception of Singapore) are third world/developing countries. However, the prevalence of obesity in most Southeast Asian countries is still lower than the West.",1211,204,asian_beauty

orioncygnus1,"Redness on face - I'm 27 male. I have a lot of redness on my cheeks, nose, and forehead. The redness is there most of the time, but sometimes it's not. This has been going on for as long as I can remember. 

I have no clue what is causing this. I saw a dermatologist about it a couple of years ago. I can't recall exactly what she said, but she put me on some prescription cream for rosacea to see if it helps, and it didn't. 

I do have some mild facial acne (a couple of pimples every now and then) still and some minor scarring, so perhaps that's a contributor? 

I also have a lot of allergies, and currently going through immunotherapy. 

I've also relatively tan from a lot of sun exposure growing up, but I've gotten lighter the past few years. My natural skin color is pretty fair. 

My skin is pretty sensitive and dry in general. I don't have a skin care routine, either than washing my face twice a day with a cetaphil/aveeno gentle face wash. I shower once a day before bed. I use a cetaphil cream on my face twice a day right after washing. I prefer creams over lotions.

I haven‚Äôt found anything that‚Äôs worked with my skin this far except for a new HGs. This is my current routine:

AM:

Beauty 360 Micellar Water

Ponds Dry Skin Cream. I‚Äôve found that this isn‚Äôt enough, as soon as I walk outside my skin feels tight again. In the last I‚Äôve used a gel moisturizer under it and it worked amazingly well. I don‚Äôt know why I stopped, I definitely need get back into it. I used the Garnier gel moisturizer in pomegranate for dry skin

I got this Lanc√¥me Spf 50 sunscreen in an influenster box, it‚Äôs worked well but it‚Äôs only a tester sample. If you have any sunscreen recommendations that would be great!

PM:

Noxzema moisturizing cleansing cream. It‚Äôs nice, but I mean I didn‚Äôt see any differences to be honest.

Thayer‚Äôs Witch Hazel Toner. I heard from somebody that I should avoid this because it‚Äôs an astringent so it‚Äôs taking the oil out of my skin (or lack thereof). I hear the laneige skin cream refiner is a HG for dry skin.

Ponds Dry Skin Cream

Once a week I use TO AHA/BHA chemical exfoliant and I really like it. I have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin, but not a dramatic difference. I think I just need to keep using it for a bit, I just got it two weeks ago.

I feel like my routine isn‚Äôt enough. I was hoping to experiment with serums such as salicylic acid to treat my acne because I find that face washes with SA irritate my skin, unless I haven‚Äôt used the right one. I recently tried out the Neutrogena pink grapefruit acne wash and oh my... never again. I heard the cerave one was good too, but i‚Äôm skeptical to try it. I hear hyaluronic acid and niacinamide are great serums for hydration and clearing skin texture, I have a lot of pores and congestion in my face that I need to clear up.

So I have found out i have dehydrated skin after using benzoyl perioxide everyday all over my face without moisturizing and of top that, my working place is playing  football, so i would stay in the sun All Day without sunscreen! So my skin is clearly dehydrated and all my red marks from the acne (hyperpigmentation) wont go away probably from sun Damage.. and it has been like that for at least 1-2 years now. So when I found out about my dehydrated skin and that scars may fade faster if the barrier is fixed i decided to buy some products and make a routine. So for 1-2 months I have tried to moisturize my skin, and off course i dont use at actives since my skin is also under ok control.

I would be so happy if u could maybe routine with my products, and maybe suggest some products, event tho there is a Lot of products I cant buy in Scandinavia.

So here is all the products I have available:

CosRX Advanced Snail 96 mucin power essence (just bought, havent tried yet)

Cerave pm moisturizer

Ordinary Rosehip oil (bought, havent tried yet)

Ordinary niacinimade 10% 
 
Cosrx toner alchohol free (bought havent tried yet)

Ordinary squalane oil 

Eucerin Urea face cream 5% (bought havent tried yet)

And my occlusive is eucerin aquaphor

I'll be in Tokyo this January, and I was wondering if you could suggest some HG Japanese products that could help with dry skin and dry lips (preferably on the cheap side). They can be toners, moisturizers, sunscreens, lip balms, lip tints, lip masks, or anything really that you want to recommend. :) I'm mostly looking for skincare products but makeup is also welcome.

So far, I've only used Hada Labo Gokujyun Hyaluronic Lotion Moist (good), Hada Labo Gokujyun Cleansing Oil (good), and Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF50+ PA++++ (bad because it made me so oily T\_\_T).

RAIMAR15,"[Review] BBIA Last Concealer - I wrote a full post [review BBIA Last Concealer](http://www.sakuranko.com/2019/12/bbia-last-concealer.html) in my blog. About this item I decided to start to share the post of my blogs here too. This is one of my favorite products of this year because fulfils all the requirements in my case for a good natural looking concealer.

![img](5604efee2e541 ""BBIA Last Concealer"")

***Features*** 

*Flawless cover like skin correction.Dense powder adheres evenly to the skin, covering skin trouble, flush, and pores, transforming into porcelain-like clean skin. Light finish like my own skin. Super light-weight texture has been applied to the skin, presenting comfortable texture! Clear all day.Expresses the skin bright as if the make-ups have just been applied.*

&amp;#x200B;

![img](87b3aq84je541 "" BBIA Last Concealer 6.2g"")

![img](vj0rffmfje541)

**Formula / Application / Texture** 

The formula is creamy this shade is #01 Light Beige and this comes with an applicator that makes the application easy. The formula provides a long-lasting effect which last around 12 hours which is great. The produt blends naturally with my foundation of BB Cream and provides a blur effect. The matte effect is not cakey and provides a sheer effect, so If you are looking for a high coverage this is not for you.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](v7c9xge0le541 "" BBIA Last Concealer #01 Light Beige"")

**Conclusions**

This concealer provides a sheer coverage with a long-lasting effect which is great for a daily makeup. I like to use this type of concealer in the mornings because the effect is a nice color to the area of my under eyes but without that annoying cakey appearance. Even when I have oily eyelids, this provides a good long-lasting effect.

I‚Äôve been using AB products for about 2 months now. I just came back from a vacation in a colder climate and, after one day of using all of my products, my skin broke out terribly. I‚Äôm thinking it could be the 2 Some By Mi products (Galactomyces vit c and the toner), but I‚Äôm not sure. This has happened a lot while trying new products. The Ordinary is a US brand that has yielded the same type of result.

One day later, it‚Äôs lessened after using La Roche-Posay Effaclar and very minimal other products. I plan to just use that wash and sunscreen for a few days.

I just need some advice on how to get this to stop happening to my skin and how to improve it. I have combo skin with a oily T zone and am concerned about large pores, fine lines, elasticity, and brightening.

I have deep under-eye circles. They‚Äôve been there since I was young but I‚Äôm now 30 years old and the skin in my black circles is becoming thin looking. 

The rest of my skin always looks unhydrated, yet at the same time feels slightly oily (not to the touch just slightly oily feeling in general). My cheek &amp; forehead skin looks rough, not smooth, and not hydrated. Also I feel like my whole face in general is feeling slightly saggy, as if the skin is just not as tight anymore. I don‚Äôt really have what are considered wrinkles, but some lines are starting to form under my eyes. Also my eyelids always seem super dry and not smooth (due to being unhydrated but also not smooth from age). This is all my information and I‚Äôve tried the best I can to describe my issues. 

What can I use to make my skin look younger and smooth and soft? Any good creams for my eyes or under-eyes? Any anti-aging creams that will help skin look softer and younger?

My skin type - mature, combination/oily-normal

Goal - to prevent wrinkles / signs of aging

Bonus - even out skin tone, better elasticity / firmness

My verdict - NOPE

Where I ordered it from: Yesstyle.com

The packaging is pretty, but the bottle is a bit fat and doesn't fit comfortably in my hand. I don't know why the plastic bottle needs to be so fat and awkward when it has only 50ml of product.

Texture is thick and sticky. Almost like honey. Spreads easily enough, and doesn't feel too terrible. Absorbs fine.

My biggest problem with the product is the scent. Mind you, I'm not new to AB products and their fragrance / perfume. I don't mind some fragrance.

But the fragrance on this essence is wild. It's overwhelming. I felt like I'm using face perfume, not topical essence. It gave me a mild headache from the scent (Certain scent gives me a headache, and this one was it)

The worst thing is the scent LINGERS FOR HOURS AND HOURS. 3 hours later, my husband could still smell it on me, 2 feet (or about 60cm) away from my face.

It's fairly rich, and it made my skin itchy and uncomfortable the 1st time. I used it for 3 days, then discontinued for 3 days, then tried again. The 2nd time was better. But the perfume was still just too much for me. It's the weirdest mix of powdery stuff your grandma might've used way back when and dusty floral scent. There is no discernible hanbang smell to it that I could detect, unlike Sulwhasoo products.

After using it on and off about 2 weeks, very inconsistently because of the smell and the mild itchiness I sometimes get from this particular essence, I quit. Yeah, it's a pricey essence, but not worth it for me. My mom wants it though, so I'm going to give it to her - she likes rich products because her skin is very dry.

Hope this helps someone. If you have any questions, let me know.

This is my first post. 23M with acne prone ""combination"" skin being treated with tretinoin, which means my skin is also very sensitive and prone to driness. I live in a very hot and humid environment, so I sweat very easily myself. Also parfum free is a plus. I have tried some Japanese sunscreens already:

- Bior√© Watery Essence: leaves me quite shiny after a while and doesn't feel very nice to me, the smell and it feels tacky to the touch if apply generously. I wanted to like it but couldn't. 

-Hadalabo UV gel: feels wonderful, almost like I never put it on, but I feel like that's partially because slides right off with the smallest tear of sweat. I only use it as a mosturizer but always put another sunscreen on top. 

- Bior√© Perfect Milk : wonderfully matte, but very bad dry patches will soon show up after some hours, and I begin getting people asking me what's wrong with my skin. 

- Skin Aqua UV super moisture Gel : not bad, but I shine badly on my T zone after some time, I don't feel much like reapplying it afterwards.

-Pyunkang Yul essence toner
-Cosrx BHA power liquid
-Mizon Snail Repair Gel
-Cosrx good morning cleanser 
-Missha Aqua Sun Gel. 

I've been breaking out ever since I started the first product (BHA liquid) about 3 months ago. I use it every other day. At first I thought I was purging but I still break out. I bought the snail gel and Pyunkang Yul toner because I thought I had over exfoliated. Stopped using the BHA liquid. But things have not improved, and my face is covered in tiny whiteheads  and large, red spots that leave weird pigmentation. 

It took a week on vacation without most of these products for me to realise that my AB products were ruining my skin (I know, it took me this long). I compared ingredients and realised that butylene glycol (in 4 of the above products) might be breaking me out. I'm not usually very breakout prone, apart from the odd whitehead. So this might be it.

Could this be the evil work of Melano CC? My skin is very tough and I‚Äôve actually never had a negative response from it so I‚Äôve got no clue what to look for in a purge vs a reaction. Maybe I‚Äôm applying CC wrong or using too much? ABers, help me!
(Also I‚Äôve washed pillow cases and sanitized my phone so I doubt it‚Äôs that)

AM routine currently:
-hado labo foaming face wash
-kikumasamune high moist lotion
-melano cc essence
-scinic AIO honey ampoule 

I‚Äôve had a lot of time with the other products in my AM and PM routines, hence why I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs Melano. Has any one else experienced this?
And HOWWW do you treat a break out like this????

TLDR; introduced a new vitamin C and now have cheek zits. Not sure if it‚Äôs a reaction, a purge or hormonal. Need to know where to go from here.

Gamarantor,"The Essential Korean Skincare Routine - Hey Reddit! I want to share with you what really worked on my skin and my go-to Essential Korean skincare routine. I always come back to this routine when my skin doesn't like a new product or when I travel. It is effortless and great for every skin type, all the products are very gentle, so they worked even on my annoyingly sensitive skin. You should always be careful and see what works for you, I'm just sharing what worked on me and friends countless times. This routine is made of three essential steps.

* **COSRX - Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**  
A gentle cleanser, to remove dirt and grime without stripping the skin of its natural oils.
* **COSRX - BHA/AHA Clarifying Treatment Toner**  
A powerful exfoliator, to unclog your pores and even out your skin tone.
* **CORSX - Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Mask**  
A nourishing moisturizer, to deeply hydrate and repair the skin from day to day damage

That's it! This is what I've been using and loving!

If you're a beginner, or not, you should try this out!

Let me know your results!",1095,194,asian_beauty

kou0830,"[Discussion] Japanese shopping sites - I know a lot of people use english websites but for those who use japanese ones like amazon and rakuten, which do you prefer?

I notice that while amazon has a wide range of products, not just skincare so you can buy all at once, they like to separate shipments so it just adds to shipping costs overseas since they're 2 boxes (if you use forwarding services like me). If your things are small they'll sometimes use a box that fits your stuff perfectly, but most of the time they use their infamous giantass box with the stuff taped to the bottom with a lot of extra space. I keep track of item weight to not go over my shipping limit and the big box tends to weight around 450g+.

Recently they stopped selling some stuff to move over to amazon pantry (they're cheap and all but their fixed box dimension exceeds my overseas shipping requirement). I resorted to Rakuten (kenko) and their boxes are 150g+. I don't know how they pack it since it hasn't arrived but taking into account the weight of the boxes, is amazon or rakuten more cost effective? The rakuten store has free shipping over 3500 yen and some coupons around 100 yen. And sometimes bonus points. While amazon only has discounts and points for certain items. I'm starting to think I'm dumb for using amazon when rakuten is lighter thus saves on overseas shipping. Prices vary a few hundred yen. Some cheaper on amazon some rakuten.",1435,257,asian_beauty

It‚Äôs not a big concern YET since it‚Äôs tiny and it‚Äôs just one, but I do have a question.

‚ÄúFormulated with 92% snail mucin, this cream helps naturally enhance a healthy glow. Used regularly, it moisturizes skin while treating irritation and improving uneven skin tone.

Snail Secretion Filtrate, Betaine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic acid, Arginine, Dimethicone, Carbomer, Panthenol, Allantoin, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol, Adenosine, Phenoxyethanol.

I'd managed to be able to get my hands some up until now and it looks like it's gone forever. I've been using it for years and had No. Plans. Whatsoever. To. ChangeThingsUp.

Here's how I use it:

In the a.m.:

As my sole cleanser. I do a 2-5 minute facial massage every morning. For this reason, I need a cleansing oil with very good cushion and slip, otherwise my skin gets irritated by the physical friction.

In the p.m.:

I only use it to take off makeup - and only on my face, not my eyes. I wear contacts so any oil getting into my eyes is real problem. For this reason, I have to avoid oils that are too runny.

I also rinse it off with micellar water-soaked cotton pads. I never follow with a foaming cleanser; I never splash or use running water. So it needs to rinse off easily without leaving any residue behind.

Here's what I've tried recently that didn't work for me:

Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - too thick and goopy; has to be washed off with water or another cleanser.

DHC - Ditto above

AmorePacific Treatment Cleansing Oil - too thin and runs into my eyes.

* **Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing 5.5 Cleanser** Been trying to look for an affordable cleanser since they reformulated my HG cerave foaming and unfortunately the *HADA LABO Goku-jyun Face Wash* just does not work for me :( been hearing good things about this one as well as *SOONJUNG PH6.5 WHIP CLEANSER,* so I thought I'd give one of those a try.
* **A'PIEU Madecassoside Cream** I finished a 50ml bottle, lasted me for almost a year and I absolutely love it. the only downside is probably the fact that it does leave a bit tacky of a feeling. This time I went for the 120ml bottle; meanwhile, I also got my hands on the *Sebamed Clear Face Gel* (non-AB.) Will be comparing which one performs better in this humid hot summer; previously I had gone through 3 tubes of the *Bioderma* moisturizer, it was almost my HG but then I hated the feeling of everything just sliding off my face when I sweat in the summer when only wearing skincare and sunscreen :(  

* **A'PIEU - Madecassoside Sun Cream SPF39 PA++**Figured I liked the original cream, thought I'd give the sunscreen version a try.  

* **Innisfree No Sebum Mineral Powder**Emptied my last can, mostly using it as dry shampoo especially when I had to style bangs.  

* **Innisfree My Real Squeeze Mask** (fig, tomato, pomegranate, green tea)Always love putting one of these affordable bad boys on :)

  


*Processing img evxwmh3ko8831...*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*My questions tho: it seems like innisfree has recently changed their logo? among all the innisfree product I ordered, only the ""f"" on the tomato sheet mask is the original design, plus, the no sebum powder packaging also seems different from the previous version?? Lastly, the A'pieu products also seems a bit off, usually, the ""40g/1.41oz."" thing would be placed between ""Cream"" and the red mark on the top right, but this time they're printed next to the A'pieu logo instead on the lower side. I can't help but wonder if I've received fakies from this online seller (tho I checked and she barely got any negative review)\*\*

Welcome the two newest mods to our team, /u/thecaticorn and /u/conceptizual! They‚Äôve actually been about, doing various modly things for the last few months, and we are super late at properly welcoming them to you.


Our new mods were chosen after our selection process, and we have been slowly training and integrating them into the mod work. We had one other mod /u/4soeur, who was recruited at the same time, but has since stepped back due to an international move. She has extensive experience modding other communities, loves gardening, and is an accomplished mother. We wish her well and all the luck! 

And to introduce our remaining recruits, /u/thecaticorn is a strong person working on her independence after graduation, and /u/conceptizual is a cheerful, easy-going and personable human. We are so lucky to have them, and thank you both for volunteering your time for the community!

More hands on deck, and more fresh ideas to add to the team! Some fun facts about our new mods:

/u/conceptizual: 

* Software engineer, loves to build infrastructure, maybe even things like mod queues
 
* Heritage is half-Mexican, but with self-described ‚Äúsolidly mediocre Spanish‚Äù

* May be our first-ever extrovert

* Really wants a pet dog but not yet

* Kpop fan, even covers dances in her spare time.

* her favorite thing she did to improve her skin was ‚Äústop being 14‚Äù

/u/thecaticorn:
* Recent IT undergrad

* Australian Representing, Indian heritage

* Solid AB community veteran

* Like all good people, also loves Avatar the Last Airbender (And Korra!)

* Into bubble tea as self-care

* Snowboarding beginner

Ever thought about joining the team yourself? Help steer the direction of your subreddit community! We can sometimes take a while to respond to (as we are not always in a recruitment cycle), but we encourage you to consider applying. We especially wish to recruit from diverse timezones for better ongoing support of the sub during all hours. We are also hoping to add perspectives from folks from LGBT+/Queer/GSM/SAGA backgrounds, folks with disabilities, older folks, and anyone with a unique perspective and a dedication to the community. Come apply! 

We love the folks who are great at self-motivated learning, diplomacy, seeing all sides of an issue, and being a good team player, as you will be working on a team with other mods from around the world. Experience modding other subs or large communities could be helpful but not required.

https://i.redd.it/j2nfet625v031.png

Cannabidiol you guess it right... it's a leaf of cannabis, this is the source of the trendy substance in skincare but don't you worry it will not get you high :), CBD short for Cannabinodial, it is one of the 113 Cannabinoids, which were isolated from the cannabis plant in 1940 by Roger Adams.  It‚Äôs got anti-inflammation properties, vitamins A, D, and E, and essential fatty acids. The CBD‚Äôs most enticing attributes are its anti-inflammatory and analgesic (pain-killing) properties, plus there is evidence that it can treat dry skin, psoriasis, and eczema, which is why the ingredient is popping up in so many face creams, serums, and body lotions.  Is it legal?  Yes, if it‚Äôs extracted from industrial hemp and labeled correctly.

Not sure if I'm allowed to post this as question outside the thread (read both the rules and guidelines and wasn't sure) so please feel free to remove if it's not meant to be here.

So, I opened a sheet mask yesterday. Used it and wiped the excess from the mask on my face, feet, and limbs as a moisturizer. I still have the remaining packet goop open on the side. Usually, I just throw it but it feels like a waste when it works so well.

What I was wondering basically is how long can you leave the packet open before using it? Does it go weird if you leave it open to the air or is it fine as long as it retains the texture? Should you refrigerate it? What are the community's thoughts on this and how long max would you leave the goop?

Aquamaraqua,"Mid-Year Product Reviews - My skintype: highly sensitive, combination (oily t-zone, dry u-zone) to normal, NC20-25

Environment: humid New York City in the summer, dry af New York City in the winter

WNR - would not repurchase

MRP - might repurchase

HG - holy grail

\*= broke out my sensitive skin but did show some effects, so it might work for you

**Cleansers:**

Kose Softymo Speedy (WNR) - aside from breaking me out (suspecting the mineral oil), it kinda sucks as a makeup remover imo It emulsifies pretty easily but it won‚Äôt remove eye makeup, and even lip makeup is a hassle to get off. This is a sub fav though, so YMMV

Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash (WNR) - I liked this when I first used it, because compared to the Rosette Cleansing Foam Green and SU:M37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick, this was much less drying, however, still a bit stripping. It still contains surfactants and I was a bit alarmed when I (accidentally) figured out it could also be used to remove blood stains off of white sheets like a clothing detergent.

Etude House Soon Jung 6.5 Cleanser (MRP) - currently a fav because it leaves only the sliiightest bit of dryness, but overall a pretty solid cleanser, only downside is that it has surfactants which may be too harsh for some. Unless I find one that‚Äôs even gentler than this and contains no surfactants, I might repurchase this.

**Toner:**

Secret Key Rose Base Toner (WNR) - THE FRAGRANCE. If you hate added fragrance, stay away. I don‚Äôt mind rose, as I love the Mamonde toner‚Äôs scent, but this one smells pretty awful. Like fake rose with a sprinkle of chemical. It‚Äôs also much stronger than the Mamonde‚Äôs and is slightly irritating for my skin. I regret purchasing this 500mL bottle that took forever to get through. Only convenient thing was because it was so watery, I could travel with it as a mist. If you don‚Äôt mind heavy fragrance and like light toners, you might enjoy this, although I don‚Äôt recommend it.

**Essences/Ampoules:**

2Sol Galactomyces Ampoule (WNR) - didn‚Äôt find this to do much for my skin, had decent hydration but I hated the feeling of it on my face, felt too greasy 

Cosrx Galactomyces 95 Whitening Power Essence (WNR) - much like the 2sol, I felt like this was all around, meh, didn‚Äôt notice any brightening with the 30mL sample I had, and I didn‚Äôt particularly enjoy the smell, so I stopped using it midway

**Treatments/Serums:**

Elizavecca Milky Piggy 100% Hyaluronic Serum (WNR) - Oh the packaging! It made me a total sucker for the product. Elegant and pretty. But that‚Äôs where the rave stops for me, personally. It felt like a normal essence-like product going on, but dried down into a weird film I could feel on my skin and also pilled at that point if I was still massaging the product into my skin. The film would make me feel more dry than before putting on the essence, so overall, I wouldn‚Äôt buy this again.

Melano CC Vitamin C Serum (WNR) - I really wanted to love this but it didn‚Äôt seem to do much for my skin. If it did fade away PIH, it wasn‚Äôt as quick as the Cosrx AHA for me, which took around 2 months for 80% fading.

Etude House Soon Jung Cica Balm (WNR) - didn‚Äôt find this to calm down my redness at all. However it did somewhat help cool and calm down my acne spots a bit. Nothing dramatic though, so I didn‚Äôt feel the need to repurchase. 

Non AB:

The Ordinary 10% Niacinamide + Zinc (WNR) - freaked my skin out into a bunch of cysts. Beware if you have sensitive skin. I noticed slight brightening, but I‚Äôm unsure if that was placebo. I stopped using it after 2 weeks once I noticed it caused cystic acne.

The Ordinary 30% AHA + 10% BHA (MRP) - had some pretty solid effects at making my skin feel smooth, and also helped to gradually fade PIH (took maybe 1 month). It did run out pretty quickly though, I went through the entire bottle with 2-3 times of use per week, in 2 months.

Timeless Vitamin C + E w/ Ferulic Acid (WNR\*) - I am so upset. It was a whole month that passed by while I was using it when I realized THIS was the product breaking me out in cysts. I thought it was due to finals stress, but nope, this stupid serum. It‚Äôs a well-loved product, so it‚Äôs probably just my super finicky skin unable to handle the 20% L-AA. I did notice some PIH lightening while using it, so give it a go if you can handle it. I‚Äôm beginning to think I should just stick with AHAs for brightening rather than vitamin C serums.

**Moisturizers:**

Muji Sensitive Skin Moisture Milk in Moisture (WNR) - a pretty nice lotion-esque product for moisture. I think those with dry skin would like this, however it does tend to pill if you don‚Äôt leave it alone after putting it on. It unfortunately broke me out, probably due to the essential oil in it. Alas, YMMV.

A'pieu Madecassoside Cream (WNR) - hated this so much. The scent was annoyingly citrusy, the texture felt too greasy on my skin, and it further caused me to break out due to the essential oils present in this product. I‚Äôd say stay away if you have sensitive skin.

**Sunscreen:**

It's Skin UV Away Moist Jumbo Sunblock SPF50 PA+++ (WNR) - I bought it due to the cost effectiveness of the product. Leaves a slightly white cast, but nothing too noticable on me. Would probably not work for those darker than NC25. It‚Äôs a pretty solid sunscreen, blends pretty easily in humid/hot weather. However if the air is even slightly dry, it‚Äôll start pilling which is a pain in the ass if you have other steps in your routine before or after it. Due to this reason, and preferring to go for PA++++, I wouldn‚Äôt repurchase this.

BIORE UV Aqua Rich BB Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++ (WNR) - also works as a makeup base, since it leaves a light pink cast with very light coverage. It was too light and pink for me. Probably would only work for those lighter than \~NC15.

**Sheet Masks:**

I‚Äôll preface this by saying I only use facemasks due to the inability to find a solid hydration step in my routine as of yet. But that may change soon due to the products I‚Äôm currently trying.

LIRIKOS Marine Energy Aqua Wrapping Mask (WNR) - I got sucked in by the packaging, let me remind myself to not do that again haha. It‚Äôs pretty moisturizing, with a unique gel-like essence. However it does have alcohol which my skin was slightly irritated by. It‚Äôs expensive for what it is, so I‚Äôd pass. 

Naruko Taiwan Magnolia Brightening and Firming Mask EX (WNR) - I did notice some brightening with this, however the essence made my face tight and I didn‚Äôt really feel as hydrated as I have with other sheet masks. It also \*might\* have broken me out. Overall a pass.

**Makeup:**

Holika Holika Jewel-light Waterproof Eyeliner (HG) - love this so much. I bought it in 2 colors, pink topaz (perfect for aegyo-sal) and olive topaz. They last very long (full 12 hour day‚Äôs worth), don‚Äôt really flake much on my undereyes. The price is right, and these are just beautiful!

3CE Mood Recipe Lipstick #218 Mirrorlike (WNR) - personally I found it too drying on my lips, exaggerating my cracks and lip lines in the process. For that price point I think it could do better.

The Saem Saemmul Mousse Candy Tint (HG) - I find these to be a slightly cheaper alternative to the Peripera Velvet tints. Similar formula, and I find these to have a better selection of colors too, albeit more concise. Longevity wise, I find them to be pretty similar to the Peripera, \~5 hours of wear before major fading. I purchased strawberry cheesecake, and then bought 2 more after loving that one: peanut and chai tea.

Peripera Sugar Twinkle Liquid Shadow in Kitten Beige (HG) - probably the most cost effective and closest dupe to the Stila Glitter &amp; Glows Liquid Eyeshadow that‚Äôs out there. Highly shiny, with big glitter flakes, pigmented, and the perfect rose gold color. It does flake when I use it on my undereyes, so proceed with caution there. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great eyeshadow.

MACQUEEN Waterproof Pen Eyeliner in Dark Black (WNR) - very dark, nice precise tip, but can get flaky over the course of the day. For that reason it‚Äôs not terrible, but I wouldn‚Äôt repurchase. I found that my Etude House Oh My Line liner was less flaky (although I didn‚Äôt like its bulky brush-tip).

A'PIEU - Juicy-Pang Tint in Fig &amp; Persimmon (MRP) - I love the glossy and plump, gel-like finnish these have. However I wish they were more long-lasting (fade after \~3-5 hours of wear depending on the color, while leaving behind a slight stain) and had a wider color selection. Aside from that, I do like these.

**Haircare:**

KRACIE Ichikami Smoothing Hair Treatment (WNR\*) - made my wavy hair really shiny! Would recommend if you don‚Äôt break out from fatty alcohols like I do, once I found out I had to be super careful to only wash my hair and not bring any of the product on my face in the meantime.

Kracie ICHIKAMI Moisturizing Shampoo (WNR\*) - made my hair more nourished and shiny, but also has essential oils which I suspect also broke me out. But if you don‚Äôt have sensitive skin, give it a try!

**Still testing:** Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner, Cezanne Skin Conditioner High Moist and Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium (love this one the most so far due to its essence-to-water texture and glowy effect)",9211,1655,asian_beauty

7606,"[Review] Short reviews on every cushion/compact I've ever used - This is just my opinion on all the cushions I've used from beginning to end (until they run out) based on my personal experience. Hope this is helpful!

I have **combination, acne prone skin** with an **oily T zone and dry cheeks**.

I live in a country with long, freezing cold/dry winters and short summers.

I've also tried the Innisfree Long Wear Cushion and The Face Shop CC Ultra Moist Cushion but because I had those such a long time ago I left them out bc I don't remember enough to say if I liked them or not lol

\-

* **The Face Shop Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Blemish Balm Cushion**
   * Coverage: sheer, more of the tone up/skincare makeup type
   * Finish: dewy/shiny
   * Longevity: 3-4 h before it got unbearable
   * Pros: this might work better for people who have dry or normal skin since the finish is so so so dewy/shiny looking
   * Cons: made my T zone look super shiny really quickly, transferred like crazy and was sticky, only comes in 1 shade
   * Overall: didn't work for me, would not repurchase
* **Moonshot microfit cushion (I think this is also known as the GD cushion)**
   * Coverage: medium at best, but I did have to build it up to get there
   * Finish: wasn't matte or dewy but more velvety
   * Longevity: 5-6 h (broke down pretty gracefully on my face tho)
   * Pros: made my face look very natural and healthy, light formula, didn't emphasize dryness
   * Cons:  I would prefer a bit more coverage tbh, on some days it settled a bit into the lines around my mouth
   * Overall: used as a daily makeup item, would repurchase because I liked the finish so much
* **PONY EFFECT Everlasting Cushion Foundation**
   * Coverage: starts at medium (+), very buildable
   * Finish: healthy? with a subtle glow 
   * Longevity: 5-7 h (also broke down pretty gracefully on my face, looked pretty and glowy when it mixed with the oils on my face)
   * Pros: natural + healthy looking finish, subtle glow, decent coverage, didn't emphasize dry patches, has diff shades with pink or yellow undertones (still not a huge shade range but more than your usual 21 23)
   * Cons:  ??? I think this was my HG for a while honestly it's hard to think of cons
   * Overall: used as a daily makeup item, super reliable, would repurchase (I even finished the refill)
* **Banila Co Water Melting CC It Radiant cover balm**
   * Coverage: sheer
   * Finish: gives skin a super subtle ""inner"" glow/radiance, super natural skin-like finish, my skin but better
   * Longevity: 6 h ish before it got a bit shiny on my T zone
   * Pros: pretty natural, I think this would look great on people who already have good skin and don't need much coverage, not drying, light formula, clung to my face like a second skin, adherence was really good and any issues I had with it getting shiny were fixed by using powder (innisfree no sebum blur pact) which let me wear it for like 10 hours and still not have to touch up
   * Cons:  had to use concealer because of the sheer coverage, stuck to dry patches sometimes, had to make sure my face was exfoliated very well before wearing this
   * Overall: I'd recommend it for people who already have good skin. Maybe I'll repurchase it when I reach that stage LOL (also this was one of those balm compacts and not one of the typical ones with the sponge so that was also interesting to try out) I actually really liked the finish of this one and I think it was the most natural of all the products I've tried
* **The Face Shop Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Calamine Tone-up cushion**
   * Coverage: none
   * Finish: gives a white cast
   * Longevity: N/A
   * Pros: has calamine, soothing
   * Cons: white cast
   * Overall: didn't do much for me, the tone-up gave a white cast and it just wasn't what I was looking for. Wouldn't repurchase.",3844,694,asian_beauty

Now, I'm all for slathering my face in snail, but honestly I don't like the idea of horse oil as horses are firmly in the ""companion animal"" part of my brain. I'm also vegetarian since birth anyway, and don't prefer eating meat.

However, it got me thinking-- whether or not its acceptable for western standards etc, horse meat has been part of the asian diet for some regions/people for generations... plus, objectively eating horse is no worse than eating beef etc.  

However, as a byproduct of the horse meat industry, it still weirds me out sometimes. What are your opinions about this/ Is anyone more familiar with the asian horse meat industry?",1197,173,asian_beauty

In addition I avoid bright colors because I like natural makeup looks, and they make my complexion look dull. I'm a warm skin tone, most likely fall. 

One problem is that my lips are quite pigmented already, so i can't use anything paler than my natural lip color or I look sickly. I prefer warm tone, muted, and natural colors, but I'm also looking for a lip product that is long lasting!

thatgirlgrace,"Are the skincare products the make and sell in South Korea the exact same as the ones they market and sell for the USA? - I have a concern about the differences between South Korea marketed skincare lines vs. the ones marketed and sold in the US. This concern only relates to brands that have specifically targeted branding for the US market. For example: Innisfree. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've noticed that the packaging and even the ingredient list for the Korean beauty product (let's say Innisfree's famous Green Tea Seed Serum) is completely different from that which is marketed and sold under the brand in America. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the Green Tea Seed Serum on what I could find as the most obvious official Innisfree site (in English, marketed to Malaysia): 

\[Innisfree\]([http://www.innisfree.com/my/en/product/productView.do?prdSeq=25420&amp;catCd01=UA](http://www.innisfree.com/my/en/product/productView.do?prdSeq=25420&amp;catCd01=UA))

&amp;#x200B;

And here is the Green Tea Seed Serum (which is actually called Intensive Hydrating Serum with Green Tea Seed) on the official US Innisfree site: 

\[Innisfree Official USA Green\]([https://us.innisfree.com/intensive-hydrating-serum-with-green-tea-seed/270670010.html?cgid=sc-green-tea-1#start=6](https://us.innisfree.com/intensive-hydrating-serum-with-green-tea-seed/270670010.html?cgid=sc-green-tea-1#start=6))

&amp;#x200B;

If you look closely, you will see packaging is completely different. Which doesn't concern me as much as the ingredient list being different. I know that USA and South Korea have completely different safety guidelines for skincare. Some things South Korea avoids that USA uses and some things USA omits that South Korea allows. If that is the case, is buying the USA version anything like buying the South Korean version or can I assume that the product has been ""compromised"" by the US marketing? Are they even technically the same product? Or maybe I need to continue buying my products from Innisfree straight from South Korea. Has anyone encountered this? What are your thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

FYI - I've only seen this happen with Innisfree. So far, I have not found any other South Korea brands that specifically rebrand and market specific products for the USA. If you do know of any other brands, please let me know.

kpsg1994,"Is it okay to use the same products for the morning and nighttime routine? - So I am transitioning my products and I'm planning to use them for my morning and nighttime routine. I've seen beauty gurus and I've read posts that people would different products for each routine so I just wanna ask you guys if I should follow suit and use different products as well. I have **combination to oily skin** and these are the items that I use:

&amp;#x200B;

**MORNING:**  
1. COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser

2. Innisfree Green Tea Balancing Skin EX

3.  Kiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment With Avocado (which I am going to replace with the Innisfree Green Tea Seed Eye Cream once I am out of the Kiehl's one)

4. Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Face Moisturizer (which I plan to replace with the COSRX Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion) 

5. Neutrogena Ultra-Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock

&amp;#x200B;

**NIGHT:**

1. COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser

2. *(done 1x week)* Kiehl's Ultra-Facial Scrub (which I think they discontinued; I am replacing this with the Innisfree  Jeju Volcanic Pore Scrub Foam) 

3. *(done 1x week)* Innisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask

4. Innisfree Green Tea Balancing Skin EX

5. *(done 1x week)* whatever sheet mask I have available

6. *(only if needed;  I don't use this all the time)* Body Shop tea tree oil for spot treatment 

7.  Kiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment With Avocado (which I am going to replace with the Innisfree Green Tea Seed Eye Cream once I am out of the Kiehl's one)

8. Kiehls Ultra Facial Oil-Free Gel Cream (which I am replacing with the COSRX Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion)

9. *(if I feel like it, usually I'll just put it on my dry spots)* Laneige Sleeping Mask 

&amp;#x200B;

Kiehl's products are amazing but **expensive** af so I had to look for alternatives. The Aveeno one I am replacing because it's good but oily. I patch tested everything so is all good. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end my facial wash, toner, eye cream, and moisturizer will be the same. Will this be okay?

myng,"[Review] Mainly Japanese skincare, octinoxate-free sunscreen,and makeup mini reviews - Hey all! I'm a long time lurker with this being my first post here so I hope the formatting of this post turns out alright. This past year I've become a lot more attentive and mindful of my skin's condition and what it reacts to, so I wanted to share my experiences with some products! Learning that I'm sensitive to the chemical UV filter octinoxate was a bummer as most sunscreen and makeup products contain it, but I have found a few products that have worked for me and hopefully they may work with anyone else with similar sensitivity.

&amp;#x200B;

Skin type: Oily, acne-prone, sensitive

Foundation shade: NC15-NC20

Current AM routine:

* Ceracolla Moisture Lotion
* Holika Holika Good Cera Super Ceramide Cream (optional, depends on what sunscreen I apply)
* Sunscreen

Current PM routine:

* Bifesta Eye Makeup Remover
* Bioderma Micellar Water
* IOPE Ideal Cleansing Foam Whipping Brightener EX
* Curology (.017% tretinoin, 4% azelaic acid, .25% zinc pyrithione)
* Holika Holika Good Cera Super Ceramide Cream

&amp;#x200B;

SKINCARE

**IOPE Ideal Cleansing Foam Whipping Brightener EX**

I'm on my second bottle of this and I don't know why my skin liked it in the past. It feels stripping, it is heavily fragranced, and I think claiming that a cleansing foam can be brightening is bogus as it doesn't sit on my face long. However, it hasn't irritated or broken out my skin and that's more than I can say for Krave Beauty's Matcha Hemp Cleanser or LRP's Toleriane Hydrating Cleanser. Off to search for a new no-frills cleanser! **WNRP.**

**IOPE Bio Essence Intensive Conditioning**

I love this and cannot justify even trying out another FTE because this fulfills the criteria of everything I want-- evens my skintone, brightens my skin, and gives the appearance of smaller pores all in a relatively short time (I feel a difference after even an initial one application) without irritating my skin. I have temporarily stopped using it as I simplified my routine to focus on hydration (due to upping my tret % two months ago), but am excited to start using it again soon! **WRP.**

**Ceracolla Moisture Lotion**

I purchased this in preparation of starting tret 5 months ago, and love it! It has a relatively clean and simple ingredient list, and did not feel overly tacky or thick on my oily skin. Using only one layer a day, I don't think it provides a dramatic or instant plumping effect, but I feel that it is reliably hydrating for me. I can definitely tell a difference in how parched my skin feels when I apply a drying sunscreen over this and without this. I'm sure this also goes for a lot of hydrating toners, but I have stopped using chapstick after this because I realized my lips stay more hydrated with this. **WRP.**

**Holika Holika Good Cera Super Ceramide Cream**

I'm on my third jar of this and cannot live without it. Thank you to someone on this subreddit who introduced it to me when I was facing a damaged moisture barrier in the past! This is a bit embarrassing, but as a 27 year old I can't recall anytime in my adulthood where my skin has been as soft as when I started applying this. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the cleanest ingredient list (essential oils, silicones, and not fungal acne safe), so as with all skincare YMMV. I heard this can be a dupe for Dr. Jart's Ceramidin Cream, but I haven't tried that one so unfortunately can't speak on that. **WRP.**

&amp;#x200B;

SUN CARE

**ACSEINE Super Sunshield EX SPF50+ PA++++**

This product is very overpriced with very little product. While there is a light peachy beige tint, this waterproof mineral sunscreen still leaves a white cast on my NC15-NC20 skin when an adequate 1/4 is applied. I wish it came with darker tints, because I did enjoy that it was very mattifying and filled in my pores quite a bit. While I'd likely use this under full coverage makeup days, I can't justify the price and small quantity! **WNRP.**

**ANESSA Perfect UV Sunscreen Aqua Booster Mild SPF50+ PA++++ (2017)**

Given the plentiful UV filters (with chemical filters that I'm not reactive to!!!!), I really wanted to love this waterproof mild sunscreen as my everyday sunscreen. However, as an oily skin girl it's difficult for me to make this work on a daily basis. On first application, it gives a powdery satin finish which I love as it feels very smoothing. However, I feel pools of grease by the 3-4 hour mark. I still would prefer to wear this when I'm outdoors for a long period of time though. **WRP.**

**Shiseido d program Allerbarrier Essence SPF40 PA+++**

I believe this mineral sunscreen is marketed as being a good protection against dust pollution, all while remaining paraben free, alcohol free, and mineral oil free. I really enjoyed that it felt light and milky, and gives a semi-matte finish with minimal white cast. It does ineveitable start becoming oily on my skin after a few hours of wear, but nothing close to the ANESSA mild. I think it's comparable to the Etude House Mild Airy Sunprise, but just a little bit less mattifying given the lack of alcohol. It surprisingly has a very different texture to its BB version that I've reviewed below. All in all, it feels elegant on the skin but I'm unlikely to repurchase since Etude House is half the price. I also am wary of how light it feels on the skin and don't feel confident in how well it protects against UV rays. **WNRP.**

&amp;#x200B;

MAKEUP

**Shiseido d program Allerbarrier Essence BB SPF 40 PA+++ (Natural)**

Being a sister product of the untinted one I reviewed above, I had thought the texture would be similar, but this one feels much thicker to wear. It provided me up to medium coverage pretty easily. I always wear this on top of a sunscreen, and found this to be more on the mattifying side. I don't think it wears well with it's sister sunscreen underneath, as it got greasy pretty quickly. However, I wore this over top Etude House Sunrprise Mild Airy and loved the matte finish! I found the color to be quite yellow, and it oxidizes a bit an hour or so after application, so I definitely want to try the Light shade next time. **WRP.**

**Ettusais BB Mineral Gel SPF 25 PA++ (Natural Beige)**

True to the brand, I found that this product did not clog my pores. The color leans slightly on the yellow side, and provided sheer light coverage. It gives a satin finish on my skin that looked nice for about the first hour and then it got really greasy really quickly. Given the lack of coverage, the short wearability, and the lack of uv protection, I would not repurchase this. **WNRP.**

**Cezanne UV Clear Face Powder SPF28 PA+++ (01 Light)**

While the mattifying strength on this pressed setting powder is nothing amazing or close to any other mattifying powders I've tried, I enjoy the way it sets my undereye concealer. It stays in place without creasing or looking cakey. Although there is very little coverage, I also liked using this powder when touching up my makeup throughout the day,as that little bit of coverage did help. It's affordable, blurs my pores well, and is great for touch ups. **WRP.**

**Canmake Quick Lash Curler (Clear and Black)**

A bit about my eyes-- I have oily hooded monolids with straight lashes that point downward. This product is marketed as a quick topcoat to use over your mascara to keep your eyelashes curled. However, I've only seen people use this as a base coat like a primer and that's the way I prefer to use the clear original version. The lasting power of the curl is amazing and really lasts all day. I then tried the black version, and felt that it sufficed as an all in one primer + mascara. It separated, curled, and provided a more volume than the Kiss Me Heroine Make Volume &amp; Curl Mascara

(all while smudging less than that mascara). The black one is definitely my holy grail. **WRP.**

**Flowfushi MOTE Mascara IMPACT 01 Volume (Black)**

On the opposite side of the mascara spectrum, I really disliked this mascara even after priming my lashes with the Canmake Quick Lash Curler. It's a tubing mascara which I've heard great things about, but the heavy formula would weigh my lashes down. Using this product alone was unthinkable because my lashes will definitely not stay curled. Due to the heavy formula, I also feel like my lashes would clump together in an unflattering way making it look like I had three sticks pointing out of my eyes. Removing this was even more difficult than removing Kiss Me Heroine Make or Canmake mascaras, even with oil cleansers or the Bifesta eye makeup remover. **WNRP.**

**Flowfushi MOTELINER Liquid Eyeliner (Black)**

What can I say about this eyeliner that hasn't been said already! It has a very lovely brush that makes drawing a cat eye almost fool proof. Lines draw on so smooth. It's not the most waterproof eyeliner I've used, but found that with an eye primer and some powder over my eyelids, this eyeliner does not budge. I'm very sad this brand is possibly being discontinued? but hopefully they are only rebranding. **WRP.**

**Flowfushi The Matsuge Biyou-eki Eyelash Serum**

Last year I had eye lash extensions for most of the year followed by a few months of having permed lashes. Needless to say, I had severely abused my lashes and as a result they were sparse and fell out quickly. I used this every night for about 15 nights, and saw my lashes grow back into their regular state prior to all the abuse. I now use it more as a preventative measure to keep my lashes from falling out prematurely as I still curl and use mascara on a daily basis, knowing that it's not going to provide any dramatic lengthening such as using something like Latisee. **WRP.**

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the next products I'd like to try-- If anyone has tried them please let me know what you think!

* Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Ferment Milk (Looking forward to brightening effects!)
* IPSA - The Time Reset Aqua (I heard this is good for controlling oily skin)
* Mychelle Sun Shield SPF50 (non-AB but like that it has 20% zinc oxide)
* Paula's Choice RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 (non-AB but also like that it has 13% zinc oxide)

thegodsjoker,"[Discussion] I want to get into asian makeup and skincare products, but I need help - So basically I don‚Äôt have any huge issues, my skin is oily and really sensitive though. I breakout when I‚Äôm under stress, but it‚Äôs usually just a few teeny tiny pimples and redness which get easily covered with make up. Other than that I have a bit of redness on my cheeks and open pores. I'm 18 by the way.

I‚Äôve known about Asian beauty for a long time but it‚Äôs just so hard to get my hands on products ‚Äòcause they‚Äôre not sold here and if they are, they‚Äôre over-priced (a single nose sheet mask for ‚Ç¨7??).

Now I‚Äôve ordered a random 10 sheet masks pack and the jeju volcanic toner from innisfree but it‚Äôs going to take a long time before they get here (ordered from YesStyle).

I‚Äôve just found Jolse and I‚Äôm lowkey hoping their shipping time is shorter (is it? I‚Äôm from Europe) and I kind of want to buy something. But I‚Äôm not sure about the ‚Äúessence‚Äù I should go for as there are so many! I was going for Etude House lotus and snail masks. What are the best ‚Äúfragrances‚Äù for my skin type (not only for the masks, but toners and stuff as well)?

I need something that actually works and cleans my skin in general, not only for the five hours after I use it. 

Do I still get results if I use masks once a week? I see that a lot of people use a sheet mask a day but I mean, that gets kinda expensive.

Also, I don‚Äôt know many brands, so any advice on that (other than innisfree, Etude House, tonymoly...)?

And what about make up? Like foundation and stuff? Moisturizers/primers?

morganadeliex,"[Discussion] Is Shisedo really a good brand? (Let's talk Ibuki and White Lucent Line) - Hey guys!

I'm not new to AB but I am new to this subreddit. For reference, my skin concerns are: dry, dull, dehydrated, malassezia acne.  

For the longest time I had been using Shisedo Ibuki Softening Concentrate and Shisedo White Lucent Eye Cream in my beauty routine, but after finding the tool that checks ingredients from this subreddit (I cant remember the name, you guys know the site I'm talking about) I saw that these products are basically HORRIBLE for my skin. 

Many ingredients in these two products rated very high for being harmful to the skin or causing acne. I purchased them because I thought Shisedo is a high-end brand and they get a lot of praise, but these products are probably the reason for my overly dry skin. 

I wanted to ask AB if I'm missing something here... I can't tell what brands are actually good anymore and I can't check every product individually. Is Shisedo a good brand? Are these products actually okay and I am reading the ingredients list wrong?

* PEG-75, which precedes the three ceramides (looks like this is derived from fatty acids but it is not itself a FA, helps with emulsion, and can act as a surfactant?)
* glycosyl trehalose, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, and sodium chloride in minimal amounts

Has anyone here tried both? Or can anyone speak to these ingredients?

sapphocating,"[Review] INSTANT HG, life forever changed by AB skincare. Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence (2017) vs. CeraVe face lotion spf 30 - I know there's probably several posts about each of these fairly popular items, but I didn't see a recent one with them both. Routine at bottom 

Skin concerns: Oily, SF, acne-prone, hot &amp; humid climate. Battling blackheads/CCs, sebum control, &amp; PIH. Formerly dehydrated &amp; oily

I waited impatiently for Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence for ~2.5 weeks from a prime dealer on Amazon which seemed to check out from the reviews.
Was using CeraVe via suggestion from ScA, purchased for about $12 without shipping.  

CERAVE FACE SUNSCREEN SPF 30 w/ ZINC OXIDE

The front says ""invisible zinc"" on the front and seems generally promising. I wanted something with definite UVA/UVB protection for my PIH, but non-greasy.

This was purchased at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond for about $13. Love that I didn't have to wait for shipping, but this still felt too greasy for my oil &amp; took 20+mins to totally absorb. The white cast was minimal on my medium pale skin &amp; seems to disappear pretty well as long as you rub it in consciously. If not, some white streaks would remain or build in my mouth corners.

Will not repurchase, but very good for what it is. I would retry this brand without the zinc oxide if I was very interested in a local option again.
 4/5 because of fantastic ingredients list (ceramides, hyaluronic acid, zinc oxide, Niacinamide) but slight white cast. I will be using the rest of this for when I will be outside or go to the beach. 

now onto my new precious..... This is my first ever AB purchase after lurking on r/asianbeauty for a couple months. 

BIORE UV AQUA RICH WATERY ESSENCE SPF 50/PA++++ (2017 version)

I got 2017 because I figured the old  formula will phase out. I got this at the recommendation of both ScA &amp; r/AB. This has a gazillion million good reviews from both places. I did a ton of research on if I wanted to use this because I'm currently obsessed with my PIH, &amp; the CeraVe had both the ceramides, hyaluronic acid, &amp; niacinamide, all very important against my woes. 

The non-greasy feeling was really important to my ability to put on makeup in the AM though, &amp; since I use CeraVe foaming cleanser &amp; daily moisturizer at PM to get my ceramides, niacinamide &amp; HA. I took the plunge

INSTANT HG STATUS. Just as described by you guys on Reddit, Biore UV is lightly gel-like, like a water-based gel moisturizer. This seems more like a straight up gel moisturizer, and less like a sunscreen that happens to be moisturizing, like my CeraVe. The difference is beautiful. I know not all AB products are made alike, just like US, but this was an A++ intro to Korean skincare for me. 

Biore UV has the broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection which is hard to find in US products, it smells A M A ZING (like very light citrus), absorbs incredibly quickly, goes on non-sticky, and lies beautifully underneath makeup. CeraVe tended to be ""grabby"" tho very light due to longer absorption time.  This feels dry with a slight feel like a silicone primer. 

5/5 will almost definitely repurchase.  I dread the day I run out. The only concern is as a daily use product, I wonder how long it will last me. I understand why people buy these in bulk. That will be the only con to this item, besides lacking the ceramides &amp;  niacinamide. The ingredients list has sodium hyaluronate listed, a plus in my book.

coffeecoffeetoffee,"[Review] korea haul in june - Hey ‚ó°Ãà I'm kinda starting to create an AB routine that works for me so I apologise if I'm doing things wrongly/ my routine isn't very complete! I will list the products I bought and what I think about them. (I have been using these products since I got them in June)

Cosrx Good morning cleanser
- This is great! It doesn't have any artificial fragrance, it smells like tea tree (which I find reassuring) and does its job. It cleanses my face without making it feel squeaky clean, and it makes my skin feel good!!! Definitely lived up to the hype in this sub :') my new HG cleanser!!!

Cosrx Blackhead power liquid
- I would just like to say that I haven't really noticed any major differences with this product (maybe yet). I put it on quite regularly (almost everyday) though my nose has started peeling recently so I might tone it down a little. However, I have noticed that I haven't seen any new blackheads forming which I am super happy about. I'm not sure if its doing anything to the blackheads currently on my face so I'm still a little unsure about this product. :/ [i will be back in korea this december, i will try purchasing the costs bha/aha toner and use it before BHPL, hopefully i will get some good results! if anyone has experience with this product i'd love to hear it]

Innisfree volcanic clay mask x2
- I bought the x2 version not knowing it was for oily skin. The lady in the store just said it was more potent so i bought it ;-;. It's looking good so far! My skin has always been pretty clear (just blackheads on my t zone), so I didn't see many changes to my face. This product does make my face seem brighter immediately after using though! So while this product is pretty good I'm not sure if its my HG yet.

Banila Co Clean It Zero cleansing oil (purifying)
- I've really enjoyed using it! I especially love how the packaging of the product is simple and no mess. It's very convenient to bring around and I don't have to worry about spills(it comes in solid form)! This is the first cleansing oil I have tried so I'm not very sure how it compares to other brands but this has been working well for me so far. ‚ó°Ãà It cleanses off all makeup on my face well!! (However, I've been trying to remove grits from my face... but I haven't been able to remove any with this .-. if anyone has any tips I would be so happy to hear it!)

Innisfree Second Skin Mask (Nourishing)
- This was really confusing to use at first... However it does its job and makes my skin feel bright and good!!! I really like it ‚ó°Ãà

Makeup products I bought
*My first time buying makeup! haha

Laneige Cushion Foundation (anti aging)
- I'm actually pretty young, I don't need the anti aging property. However, the sales lady at the Laneige I was at explained that the finish of this particular cushion was slightly nicer, and dewier compared to others. I am completely in love with it!!! It is very convenient to apply/ touch up, and does not really transfer which is great for me. It looks very flattering and pretty as well would definitely recommend ‚ó°Ãà 

Nature Republic Eyeshadow palette
- The colours are pretty and it is value for money for the number of colours, even compared to other AB brands. However, I noticed that when I put it on my eye its not super pigmented? It is sufficiently pigmented but not really and it doesn't really blend well imo. also, when i rub my finger/ brush on it, a lot of little (idk what to call it) eyeshadow bunnies form which I cant use and makes the whole palette really messy (imagine eraser dust but eyeshadow). It's really annoying and for that reason alone I might not repurchase this product.

Play 101 Pencil from etude house
- I use it as eyeliner, does its job. I tried to use it as an eyebrow pencil and blend it out but its not very bendable :&lt; I may have to purchase another product specifically for my brows in the future.

Concealer from the Saem
- HG!!! This is great!!!!! I love it!!!! Only thing is when I sweat it comes off? (i think) are all concealers like this?

Innisfree no sebum powder
- HG!!! refreshing feeling and mattifys my makeup and keeps it in place!!! major love omg

Etude House dear darling tint
- HG! Purchase this if you want that cute/ natural Korean Drama look. Very easily blendable. Strange fact: It tastes really good too! xD no kidding!!! it doesn't taste of chemicals at all! it just tastes sweet.

3CE creamy lip colour
- HG!!! This is just so moisturising and beautiful. It offers you that Kylie Jenner lip kit look for so much less and its very moisturising if your lips are cracked/ just not smooth in general. Would definitely repurchase! [3ce lipsticks are really dry though .-.]

Etude house Matt Chic Lip Laquer
- never purchase this again. Smell is gross, colours are pretty but it really highlights the flaws on your lips? I don't particularly like the texture either this is gross.

Thanks for reading till the end! Hope my post was useful ‚ó°Ãà Would glad to hear your opinion/ tips if any!!!

chemical_syntax,"PONY EFFECT Coverstay Cushion Review - I was looking for a new foundation and this was recommended to me by my friend‚Äôs mother, the biggest makeup queen I know. This is my first ever cushion foundation so I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect going in. I also didn‚Äôt find too many reviews about it, so I went in totally blind. I hope this will help someone!

*Starting Points*

I am of Asian descent, with neutral undertones. I was matched to the shade colour Natural Ivory. (I don‚Äôt know my Mac shade, sorry!) This shade was actually paler than my skintone, but more on that later. My skin concerns include redness, unevenness, and freckles. I don‚Äôt struggle with breakouts except when I‚Äôm on my period. I have been using this cushion consistently for 2 months.

*Packaging*

The packaging is simple but elegant. I‚Äôm a big fan of the rose gold and the compact feels heavy and sturdy. Because the finish is matte-ish instead of glossy, it has proven to be resistant to foundation-filled fingers and other makeup stains.

I can‚Äôt compare the included puff/sponge to that of any other brand, but I am definitely satisfied with it. It feels substantial and wear-resistant, and picks up the product nicely. It has a silky texture and blends very well. This is small, but the little silk strap is also sown on very well. I have had issues with powder puffs‚Äô straps ripping off, but none to date with this one.

The mirror is large, taking up the entire inside of the compact lid. It is of great quality, very precise. The only thing I will say is that the sponge, when saturated with product, transfers foundation onto the mirror. After 2 months of use, the mirror is covered to the point of uselessness. (Tbf, it‚Äôs an easy fix. I‚Äôm just lazy.)

*Coverage and Wear*

This cushion provides medium-full coverage and a semi-matte finish. The coverage is enough to even out my complexion and cover any redness, but my freckles still show through. Though the shade matched to me is too light for my skin by Western standards, it works fine in Asia. I just take care to blend it into my neck.

The formula is pretty watery compared to regular Western-style foundations, and sinks into your skin a few minutes after application. It is extremely comfortable to wear, light and airy. 

The finish, as I said, is semi-matte and not the full matte as promised. I prefer a proper matte, so I always set it with a translucent powder. Moreover, I am currently based in a hot and humid climate, and so anything less than matte will devolve into a greasy, shiny mess.

Wear time on me is roughly 5 hours without touch ups. This is provided I am not spending a lot of time outside, which would cause me to sweat like a pig and constantly wipe my face. On days like that, I really can‚Äôt speak to the wear time.

*Final Thoughts*

As you‚Äôve probably deduced, I love this foundation and have already purchased a backup. My previous HG was Diorskin Forever, and that has been sadly discontinued. The PONY EFFECT cushion will take over, at least until I go back to North America, where I might prefer a darker foundation.

I hope this was helpful! Please let me know if you have any questions!",3157,564,asian_beauty

Caylin1,"Do you really know virgin hair? - A lot of people asked me for [virgin hair](https://easyvirginhair.com/), but when I introduced the real virgin hair to them, they feel shocked about its price. So I wondered do you guys really know virgin hair?

The virgin hair is very hard to collect. Because it should be from one single donor and the hair is [unprocessed](https://easyvirginhair.com/) and untouched that means it should not be dyed, bleached or steamed. Once it is processed, it is not virgin hair any more. 

*Processing img t9e097qnth511...*

The[ remy hair ](https://easyvirginhair.com/products/copy-of-ishow-blonde-hair-brazilian-body-wave-3-bundles-613-color?variant=4472982536203)is different, it is just cutically aligned hair which could be processed or restyled in any way. For example, you can dye it to the color you like, you can straighten or steam it to the style you prefer, such as kinky curly, water wave, yaki, body wave, [loose wave](https://easyvirginhair.com/collections/loose-wave-hair) ect. 

*Processing img c8thto7pth511...*

The non-remy hair I think it is the most common hair in the market. This kind of hair is the left over hair which is usually collected on the floor in the salon or temples, and then recycle to make a weft. The hair cuticles are facing various directions, so this kind of hair will got tangle and become matte quite easily.",1382,208,asian_beauty

hillard429,"My Thoughts: Manyo Factory, Isntree, Sioris &amp; More - **About Me:**  26 years old w/normal, acne prone skin. Main skin concerns are large pores, some hyperpigmentation, and aging gracefully (hit me up in 30 years to see if all the sunscreen was worth it). I live in the middle of Pennsylvania, so think cold winters and humid-as-heck summers. Seriously, it‚Äôs felt like wading through water outside this month. Also, I‚Äôve got really irritating seasonal allergies that make my skin a little more sensitive in the spring/summer.

**Isntree Green Tea Fresh Toner**

For me, this product was only useful in one way: it was out of stock when I originally wanted to buy it, and so I bought the Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner instead which is amazing. 

What should you know? It smells like‚Ä¶.you guessed it‚Ä¶.green tea. It feels like water. It didn't really do anything for my skin, positive or negative. Buy it if you collect green tea products and don‚Äôt really care about results. Otherwise, don‚Äôt waste your money. 

**Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner**

I feel like this is a product everyone knows about. It works well with the whole ‚Äúlayering light layers of hydration‚Äù mentality, and it truly does pack a punch. I usually do 2-3 layers of this morning and night. I went a few weeks not using this after I finished my first bottle and that‚Äôs when I realized how much it had done for me. I‚Äôm on my third bottle now and will RP til I feel adventurous enough to try something new.  

**Manyo Factory Ultra Moist Spa Ampoule**

I never had a HG product and then there was this. I almost feel bad reviewing this because my love makes me biased, but here goes nothing. As far as scent goes, this smells like most other Manyo Factory products I have sampled...it‚Äôs a unique smell that I can really only describe as herbal I guess. I find it very pleasant and for anyone concerned about scent, it‚Äôs very minimal and doesn‚Äôt linger. The first ingredient is algae extract, but it‚Äôs also got hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, squalane, and a bunch of plant extracts and antioxidants. 

The first time I used this, I almost couldn‚Äôt believe it. I put it on, walked away from the mirror, came back five minutes later, and my skin was visibly brighter in the areas where I have acne scars/irritation. It goes on lightly and sinks in quickly, drying to a beautiful, smooth, glowy finish. It is absolutely perfect for layering under other heavier moisturizers, but there are times where I can get away with just several layers of hydrating toner, this, and sunscreen. 

I will keep using this product until the end of time. I would recommend it to anyone interested in layering several lighter layers of moisturizers, and especially to anyone who deals with areas of irritation. It‚Äôs so soothing and feels like a breath of fresh air to my skin every time I use it.

**Manyo Factory 4GF Eye Cream**

This product has got a stellar group of ingredients: bifida ferment extract, peptides, shea butter, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, oils, plant extracts, ALL the good stuff. It‚Äôs a pretty thick cream, but it pats/rubs in nicely. I received a sample of this and the MF Caviar Vita Eye Gel, which I think had my preferred texture, but didn‚Äôt have noticeable results.

This is definitely a product that gets better with prolonged usage. After 2+ weeks of using, I saw significant reduction in the lines under my eyes and the redness that used to be present was gone. I'm not married to this eye cream, but things are getting pretty serious.

**Sioris Stay With Me Day Cream/You Look So Young Night Cream**

I‚Äôm not sure what I should have expected with these, considering the top ingredient is Prunus Mume Fruit Water, but these products smell heavily like raisin. It is not a smell I enjoy, and the performance of both of these was just okay for me: not super hydrating and oh, God, the smell. I only bought mini‚Äôs, and will finish out using these on other parts of my body not so close to the nose.

**Sioris Cleanse Me Softly Milk Cleanser**

Again, I only purchased a mini of this, and it is the only Sioris product I would considering buying in a full size version. It‚Äôs very gentle yet removes any leftover mascara that may still be on my face after using makeup remover. The scent doesn‚Äôt linger with this product, so it‚Äôs much more enjoyable to use.

**Sioris Time is Running Out Mist**

The scent is strong, but it does dissipate pretty quickly. Overall, I enjoyed using this. It really did provide relief to my face on days where I felt a little dryness in the afternoon. I sometimes used this in the evenings before applying makeup to go out, just to refresh my face from the day without cleansing. I will not repurchase because it really doesn‚Äôt add much to my routine, but it was fun and came in a cute mini-sized bottle.

**Stratia Liquid Gold**

What more can I say that hasn‚Äôt already been said? It‚Äôs a great product that I both love and hate. It‚Äôs more than I‚Äôd like to pay for the size, sometimes I don‚Äôt pat it all in while applying and it leaves yellow streaks around my forehead, and honestly, the finish isn‚Äôt perfect. That being said I‚Äôm on my third (or fourth?) bottle because I haven‚Äôt found anything else that works nearly as well.

**Sunday Riley Brightening Enzyme Water Cream**

Typically this would be way out of my price range, but I won an Amazon gift card and thought, why not give it a try? I had read some positive reviews, so I had pretty big expectations, and I‚Äôm still not sure if it‚Äôs lived up to them.

I like the scent. It smells like how some magical garden would smell after a light rainstorm, herbal/woody/fresh. The texture is perfect, it really does feel like you are being drenched in hydration. Ultimately, though, I didn‚Äôt notice any real improvement to my skin. I feel like what sets this apart from other, cheaper moisturizers or creams is a more cosmetically elegant formula.",5898,1039,asian_beauty

amazonstorm,"[Guide] Cost Breakdowns Of Shipping Between Stores - Okay, so earlier today, I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8tfzs9/review_why_you_should_not_patronize_beautyboxkorea/) post, which came off as a lot of bitching about company shipping prices without proof or research to back my claim up. 

So, at the suggestion of someone on Discord, I decided to do a more detailed breakdown of the prices of shipping between the various stores, using a small test item that everyone had.  These are my findings (all prices in USD).


For the purposes of this test, I chose the Etude House Play Color Eyes Cherry Blossom palette and I chose the following stores:

* BeautyBoxKorea
* BeautyNetKorea
* Cosmetic-Love
* iBuyBeauti
* Jolse
* Korea Depart
* RoseRose Shop
* Sweet Corea
* Tester Korea
* YesStyle


**BeautyBoxKorea**

On this site, the shipping costs come out to

* EMS: $27.49
* Standard Shipping By Weight: $11.05
* DHL: $24.48
* UPS: $9.11

BBK does not reveal what the total weight of the package is, but on the product page, shown [here](https://imgur.com/a/IhhCroA), it's listed as .17kg.


**BeautyNetKorea**

The shipping costs here come out to

* Korea Post (Air Mail): $3.05
* Korea Post (Air Packet): $5.63
* EMS: $25.09

BNK tells me that the weight of my item, detailed in [this](https://imgur.com/a/7JnvYPP) screenshot, is about 92g. I'm assuming that's the full weight of my package. 

**Cosmetic-Love**

Cosmetic-Love, like some other sites, tells me the weight of my package before checkout and also allows me to calculate my shipping costs without having to go through the checkout process.

The shipping costs, outlined in  [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/kTCNzzq) are

* K-Packet: $5.26
* EMS: $20.48
* Air Parcel: $21.36

Cosmetic-Love also told me that the weight of my order is about 105g. 


**iBuyBeauti**

This site actually offers cheaper and free K-packet shipping depending on how much you buy.

Their prices are

* Economy: $3.40
* K-Packet: $5.80
* EMS: $26.50

The site doesn't tell me how much the order weights, but according to the product info page, it's about .2kg.

**Jolse**

Like YesStyle, Jolse offers free shipping no matter the weight class ($40 for k-packet, $150 for expedited), but I decided to add them here anyway for the sake of comparison.

* Economy Shipping: Free
* Standard Mail/K-Packet: $2.50
* EMS: $22
* DHL: $27


**Korea Depart**

Okay, right up front, Korea Depart actually adds the weight to the packaging (400g) to the total weight of your order, so this comparison is going to be a little funky.

They only have two options to the US, EMS and K-Packet

* EMS: $22.84
* K-Packet: $9.56

According to Korea Depart, the item weight is about 87g and then they add an additional 400g to the weight when doing the shipping, hence the slightly higher prices. 

**RoseRose Shop**

RoseRose, like Cosmetic-Love and Sweet Corea, has the weight of the package right there on the shopping cart list and like iBuyBeauty, Sweet Corea and Cosmetic-Love, lets you calculate your shipping costs before you check out.

The shipping costs come out to

* K-Packet: $4.92
* EMS: $20.06
* Air Parcel: $21.96
* DHL: $24.72

According to this shop, the weight of my item is about .10kg, although as depicted on the cart page, it‚Äôs really .095kg, but I can‚Äôt fault people for rounding up. 


**Sweet Corea**

This site also lets you see the shipping costs before checkout. 

Their prices are

* Registered Air Mail/K-Packet: $6.08
* EMS: $26.08
* DHL: $29.90

According to them the package weight is about .13kg


**Tester Korea**

Tester Korea‚Äôs prices are all in Won, so I had to do some conversions. I also included a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/5XyJlsz) for proof of the original Won prices. 

Their Costs are

* K-Packet: $4.73
* Air Parcel: $21.13
* EMS: $23.83
* DHL: $31.78

According to Tester Korea, the weight is about 108g, which puts it in line with most of the other stores on this list. 

**YesStyle**

Last but not least, we have YesStyle. Like Jolse, they offer a flat rate shipping worldwide with free tiers depending on what country you‚Äôre shipping to. For the purposes of this comparison, we‚Äôre using the US prices.

Their costs are

* Premium Standard: $3.99
* Express: $12.99

Like Jolse, they don‚Äôt bother putting package weight on their page, as its free no matter how much you ship, just as long as you meet the threshold. This applies worldwide. 


So, in conclusion, I have learned that while BBK is not overcharging for the EMS shipping costs, as they are right in line with just about all other stores who go by weight (with Cosmetic Love and RoseRose Shop being the cheapest at $20.48 and $20.06 respectively), they *ARE* overcharging for their standard shipping by weight as it is much higher than any other site on this list. 

Let's look at the numbers again for standard shipping/K-Packet:

* BeautyBoxKorea: $11.05
* BeautyNetKorea: $5.63
* Cosmetic-Love: $5.26
* iBuyBeauti: $5.80
* Jolse: $2.50
* Korea Depart: $9.56
* RoseRose Shop: $4.92
* Sweet Corea: $6.08
* Tester Korea: $4.73
* YesStyle: $3.99

These are all the standard shipping prices for the same small item. Korea Depart's is the second highest, but they tell you right up front that they add packaging to the total weight, which explains that.  

I hope this breakdown was helpful and if you'd like to look at my more detailed document outlining these prices, you can look at the PDF I made about it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ivt16aw2I7PGHG_67TRRoJEILQpbG1nS/view?usp=sharing)

Millietops,"[Discussion] For those allergic to snail mucin - what symptoms clued you in to it? - I have a well known shellfish allergy, which also means I'm allergic to crustaceans such as crabs, shrimp and lobsters, and molluscs such as oysters and snails. Nothing sucks more than having to stop eating take away Chinese food because of oyster sauce as an ingredient.  I can touch oyster shells and pearl but cannot consume the oyster meat.  Allergies are a persnickety thing. 

My reaction to snail mucin is hives - bad hives. I know some folks on this board get incredibly passionate about snail mucin and think I'm lying when I state I'm allergic to it....folks, I'm not.  Today I tried a cream that I didn't realize had snail mucin...and I didn't think to check the ingredients because it's a European product.  The product wasn't even on my skin 2 minutes and I felt this intense need to scratch my face.  I touched it and felt raised welts and then looked in the mirror.  I ran to wash my face and pop a Claritin but here I am, 10 hours later and I still have raised bumps, but at least they are going down but still itchy and still there.

catsidtrip,"[Review] Sulwhasoo Brightening Serum and other AB products - Everyone, pay attention now. I've been on a strict No Buying Anything since Q3 last year when my skin went haywire after a trip to the US. This gave me a chance to finally finish all the junk I've bought after my skin has calmed down (after a month of tetracycline!).

Today, realising I ran out of sheet masks, I did this routine of Beauty Pantry Cleanup: 
* Niod - Flavanone Mud (10 mins)
* Sulwhasoo - Brightening Serum
* Chegar - Self-Renew Skin Activator (basically a moisturiser high in Squalane)

Ya'll. *wipes tears*
My skin was poreless. The only thing that was different in this routine compared to my usual (weekly Flavanone, daily Chegar), was that I found those damn Sulwhasoo samples I probably got from RoseRoseShop.

I couldn't believe how smooth my skin felt, so in the evening I washed my face with water, pat dry, and used another sample of Brightening Serum. While my skin was absorbing it, my pores started reducing in appearance again. It gave my skin the illusion of being clear. I mean, it's currently zit-free with some PIH, according to my dermatologist, the skin on my jawline is completely clear whereas my cheeks closer towards my nose had big pores. I never knew those big pores had the potential to be nonexistent like my jawline. 

I looked at Sulwhasoo's price and died a little. Anyway, here's a list of all the products I've finished or almost finished. After I'm done with all my products,  I legit only want to live on Sulwhasoo, sunscreen and water to wash my face.

* [The Ordinary - Niacinamide+Zinc](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-niacinamide-10pct-zinc-1pct-30ml)
I have mixed feelings about this. It definitely made my skin brighter, to the point where I couldn't find any concealer that would match. Had to mix Nars Custard and MAC NC25 for the closest match. Not sure if I would purchase again, though I'd give this a 5/5 if you have dull and sallow skin and want to look awake and well, bright. Not necessarily fairer.

* [Sidmool Dr. Troub - Niaten Serum](https://m.ebay.com/itm/Sidmool-Dr-Troub-Skin-Returning-Niaten-Serum-30ml-1oz-K-beauty-Niacinamide-10-/252942514260)
Saw a Reddit AB recommendation on this product, since I have some hardcore stubborn PIH, I thought this would help since it has Alpha Arbutin as well (2%?). I used this after I finished TO's Niacinamide. Well the Niaten Serum did jackshit. Texture is like water. I've used it in place of my toner, I've layered it with toner, I've layered it with moisturiser, and also used it on top of moisturiser. No difference at all, but at least I didn't break out from it. 0/5? My skin is back to being sallow like prior to using TO.

* [Sidmool Dr. Troub - Alpha Whitening Power Ampoule](https://www.ebay.com/p/Sidmool-Alpha-Whitening-Power-Ampoule-12ml/1278148789)
I'm not sure how this was added into my cart, but it did. Texture is a bit sticky but I don't mind. No fragrance, which is great... but it also does jackshit. No change in skin texture or colour. One thing to note though, I didn't break out from it, but everytime I use it, my eyes get SO ITCHY. I'm not allergic to bee products, but somehow this ampoule makes me scratch my eyes like I have cat fur as my eyelashes. I stopped using it after a month. Took me a while to realise that it was this product causing me so much misery. 0/5. I use this on my hands and feet now. The bottle is tiny but can last long. (In case you're wondering, no I didn't even put it near my eyes)

* [iS Clinical - Active Serum](https://www.isclinical.com/active-serum.html)
This was prescribed by my dermatologist, it was so bloody expensive but I was desperate. From what the dr says, it seems like a miracle product. She said I should use it sparingly because it dries out the skin, but it will help with my acne and scarring and oiliness. My skin is quite resilient, so I've been using it every other night or so, before moisturiser. I don't care for the menthol and cooling sensation. I suppose it did help with my acne (hard to say, I was on tetracycline), my skin is overall less oily (again, tetracycline), my acne scars are slow to heal (usually takes a month, this time it has been more than 6 months). 3/5? Won't repurchase.

* [Chegar - Self-Renew Skin Activator](https://www.chegar.net/product-page/self-renew-skin-activator)
This has been my go-to cream moisturiser, the tube is small but a little goes a loooooong way! I like that it's pretty non-reactive and versatile, when my skin is feeling extra dry and flaky, I mix it with TO's Squalane, and when I'm feeling lazy for two-step routines, I mix it with TO's Niacinamide. Will probably repurchase if I'm too broke for Sulwhasoo. 5/5

* [NIOD - Flavanone Mud](https://niod.com/product/flavanone-mud-50ml)
A little on the pricier side of mud masks but I love it! It's the only mud mask that shows some kind of result on my relatively clear skin. Pores are less visible (smaller, more shallow), overall face feels so smooth. It does burn a bit when I forget to use it for a long time, guess it really pulls out all the junk from the pores. 5/5 will repurchase, I think this is the best wash-off mask I've ever used. Better than GlamGlow, Queen Helene, and generic ghassoul mud.

*[Son &amp; Park - Beauty Water](https://www.hermo.my/mall/20967-son-park-beauty-water-340ml)
Saw a skincare Instagrammer rave about this product, so I immediately purchased this as I was finishing my Thayer's Rose water (5/5 btw). Err it's a bit soapy when you use too much of it, but the bubbles disappear and it doesn't sting. Doesn't make a difference to my skin. Not even extra moisturising. Now I'm stuck with a big bottle. 2/5 won't repurchase.

* [Sulwhasoo - Brightening Serum](https://us.sulwhasoo.com/snowise-brightening-serum)
Guys, how do I justify the price? What is life? 5/5 I'll keep on buying the samples till I get rich or die trying. I've also tried other Sulwhasoo samples (Essential Balancing Water, Balancing Emulsion EX) and they work so well on my skin. All of them are highly moisturising without being too oily, every single drop is absorbed and my skin feels so supple after each use. 

* [Laneige - Moisture Kit](https://m.ebay.com/itm/Laneige-Moisture-Trial-Kit-Basic-Step-4-items-Water-Emulsion-Serum-Cream-/162314955041)
My cousin gave me this kit as a gift. Overall, 2/5. It wasn't moisturising enough and I suspect it's because of the fragrance and alcohol. 

Still waiting to be finished on my shelf are TO's 5% Lactic Acid, TO's AHA+BHA mask (the red one), both of Drunk Elephant's Night and Rise duos (I broke out after using one of them, but wasn't sure if it was my hormones or the product, so I stopped after using them twice), Cur√©l Moisture Milk, and I think that's it! 

Currently waiting for checkout (don't judge) are (I can't decide) 
1. [TO - Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin 2%](https://deciem.com/product/rdn-ascorbic-acid-8pct-alpha-arbutin-2pct-30ml)
2. [TO - Ethylated Ascorbic Acid 15%](https://deciem.com/product/rdn-ethylated-ascorbic-acid-15pct-solution-30ml)
3. [TO - 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder](https://deciem.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g) (Most likely to purchase this as I can mix it with my other moisturisers with no niacinamide and leftover TO Squalane)

Sorry for the long post! Hope this helps! Let me know if I've used any of the products wrong to warrant such bad reviews, or if you have any suggestions on how to lighten PIE/PIH, or if you are using Sulwhasoo, should I abandon everything in life and dedicate all my moneys to it.",7585,1235,asian_beauty

I massage my face a few minutes in the morning and it helps me wake up and reduces the puffy-sleepy look I have going in the morning. It rinses clean and leaves my skin soft, hydrated, and matte.
* **Shiseido Aqualabel White Up Lotion 2** - I hate this bottle so I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again. It‚Äôs a rock-hard plastic bottle that makes it hard to get out. The toner itself is fine and smells nice, but nothing I‚Äôve tried has done much to lighten my melasma mustache. It absorbs easily and adds a bit if a dewy look.
* **EltaMD UV Shield SPF 45** - also on neck, chest, and arms. I live in Florida so the sun is intense year round, and I‚Äôm in a tee shirt most of the year. AB sunscreen seems to make me super shiny, but not oily, while this is more of a matte finish. It also lasts longer than any AB sunscreen I‚Äôve tried, plus it comes in a 7 ounce bottle for $45 that lasts a full year! I like it, as much as you can like a sunscreen. 
* **The Saem Saemmul Perfect Pore Balm** - this comes in a compact, and it keeps me matte well into the afternoon. Definitely recommend for shininess. However it doesn‚Äôt control oil production. 

I reapply with **Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence** if needed. This makes me shine if I‚Äôm not already shiny in the morning, but for reapplication when I'm oily mid-day, it doesn‚Äôt add shine and helps with the oil. I tone it down with **Etude House Dear Girls Pact**, which is okay but the fragrance is too much for more than just on-the-go occasional use. 

_____
***- night -***

* **The Face Shop All Clear Oil Cleansing Whip** - This is really hard to wash off in the sink so I use it in the shower. 

* **Innisfree Bija Trouble Facial Foam** - I love this cleanser! It creates a fine foam and leaves my skin soft. I think combined with the lotion it‚Äôs definitely helped my acne. I also use it on my chest &amp; beck in shower.
* **Shiseido Aqualabel White Up Lotion 2** - see above review.
* **Innisfree Bija Trouble Lotion** - super light and absorbs easily. Helps with acne. 
* **The Saem Chaga Anti-Wrinkle Emulsion** - This has reduced the number of fine lines in my eye area, as well as on my chest from sleeping on my side and having boob squishage
* **TonyMoly Green Tea Watery Eye Cream** - I think this has reduced the number of fine lines in my eye area as well, but it doesn‚Äôt absorb. I think it‚Äôs called ‚Äúwatery‚Äù because it looks like my skin is wet for almost an hour. 
* **The Seam Power Spot Cream PHA Soft Peeling** - for melasma mustache. Nothing helps my melasma and this doesn‚Äôt seem to be an exception, but I will finish the tube and hope. 

_____

***- once a week -***

* **Retin-A Micro 0.1%** - it‚Äôs way too strong for me but was over $100 so I‚Äôve been mixing it with **Embryolisse Lait Cr√®me Concentre** (my old too-heavy moisturizer) half and half each before applying. I also apply it at the end over the top of everything. 
* **Missha Super Aqua Peeling Gel** - this really gets the flaky skin off a couple of days later if I accidentally overdid it with the Retin A. 
* **Makeup Artists Choice** - I have the **55% Lactic** and **50% Glycolic** peels: I got these for my melasma but they work better for improving overall skin texture and clearing pores. I‚Äôm not sure I would repurchase these two. I also have the **15% Salicylic Acid** peel which I use only on my nose and it completely clears sebaceous filaments! I will definitely buy this again. Sometimes I‚Äôll get weird and use all three by using the glycolic acid on my forehead and chin, lactic on upper lip and cheeks, and salicylic on nose. I did not start off like this - please use caution and follow the instructions when you first start with acid peels! I‚Äôve been using them for 2 years and it look months to feel comfortable with knowing how long to leave the peels on and what acids worked where. Also you cannot use this within 24 hours of a retinol treatment - I usually wait 48 hours to be safe.

_____

The main thing that I don‚Äôt like with my nightly routine is that the products used together don‚Äôt absorb or feel dry to the touch. The products used alone will soak in &amp; feel dry, but layering them results in a kind of sticky mess. I usually sleep with a silk eye mask to block light, but it sticks to my face and is really uncomfortable. Not sure if anyone else has this problem with layering but I would love to discuss the issue! None of the products are heavy and I don‚Äôt use a lot at once, maybe a bit more than a pea size of each. Any advice or questions let me know!

xPawreen,"[Review] TonyMoly The Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream - **My Skin:**

I have combo skin. I am acne-prone on my chin, dry on my nose, normal on my cheeks and forehead. Some of the skin issues I have are the occasional whiteheads, redness/blotchiness, PIH, dullness, dark circles, and large SFs. I live in an area where the weather, temperature, and humidity are all very mild. I work in an office and I‚Äôm pretty sure that I‚Äôm allergic to something in the environment; being at work makes me sneeze a lot and gives my face some minor redness and blotchiness.

Although I rotate products in and out of my routine fairly frequently, I generally have a pretty simple routine. I‚Äôve been using the [TonyMoly The Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream](http://www.jjj-shop.com//jjj/Image/Cosmetics/Tonymoly/GTWC_T_1.jpg) twice a day as the last step of my AM and PM routine for roughly 1.5 months now. I‚Äôve heard lots of good reviews on this cream so I bought it to replace my CeraVe PM Lotion (RIP, murdered by reformulation).

**AM Routine:**

* Rinse with water and Etude House konjac 
* Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion
* TonyMoly The Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream
* Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask

**PM Routine:**

* CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser
* Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion
* Papa Recipe Bombee Honey Mask (1-2x a week)
* Stratia Liquid Gold
* TonyMoly The Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream
* Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask

**Product Performance:**

While using this cream, my cheeks and forehead felt soft and looked bright. It didn‚Äôt cause any breakouts on my chin, probably because it is a very light cream. In fact, it‚Äôs so light that I think it‚Äôs not suitable for people with dryer skin. Although my cheeks are forehead were fine, my nose and the skin around the sides of my nose got dryer and flakey after a few weeks of using this product.

This surprised me because I was using the cream in conjunction with Stratia Liquid Gold and Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion. I thought these layers would be enough to deal with dryness and flakiness. For reference, prior to buying the TonyMoly cream, I was using only Hada Labo Gokujyun and CeraVe PM Lotion for moisturizing my face, and it was enough to keep my skin happy.

The green tea in this product didn‚Äôt help much with reducing redness/blotchiness on my face (from zits, allergies, or environmental irritations) but it helped with soothing. The cream feels nice and cooling, and soothed some minor stinging I had on the irritated skin around my mouth (I‚Äôm not sure what the cause of irritation was though).

**Packaging, Consistency, Scent, Layering, Etc.:**

The cream comes in a little plastic jar with a cute and simple design. The jar is less hygienic than a tube, but personally I don‚Äôt mind that much. It has a lemony scent that is light, pleasant, and refreshing. I absolutely love the smell of it but it disappears quickly after application, so it shouldn‚Äôt bother people who are sensitive to smells.

The consistency is very thin, lightweight, and gel-like. The cream practically melts onto your skin and feels very light after application, which would be suitable for people living in humid areas. It doesn‚Äôt make me look shiny or feel sticky, but leaves a soft, satiny finish. It also spreads very easily, so a little goes a long way. It‚Äôs both long-lasting and inexpensive (I bought the 60mL size for about $12 USD on jolse) which is a bonus for ABers on a budget.

The cream absorbs well on bare skin or on top of Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt absorb as nicely on top of Stratia Liquid Gold. I generally don‚Äôt do much wait times between my layers, but I had to wait for my Liquid Gold to absorb and dry completely before layering the TonyMoly cream on top, otherwise it would pill. I also prefer to rub my products on (like the heathen I am), but I found that patting the cream on top of the Liquid Gold also helped reduce pilling if I was too impatient/lazy to wait.

**Rating/Repurchase**

Despite seeing so many rave reviews on this product, I would rate it 3/5. I had no adverse effects from using the cream, but this product didn‚Äôt amaze me in any way. There are lots of other products out there that are more effective at moisturizing, soothing, reducing redness, and brightening your complexion (Cosrx Snail 96 Mucin, Holika Holika 99% Aloe Vera Gel, Benton Snail Bee Essence, MBD Black Pearl Masks, etc.). I wouldn‚Äôt repurchase it and a big factor is that it wasn‚Äôt moisturizing enough for my dry areas. But some ABers might like this cream; such as if you are looking for a light moisturizer, if you plan to use heavier layers on top, if you live in a very hot and humid area, if you have normal/oily skin, etc.

This is my first comprehensive review so I hope it was helpful and not too long!!

I am not hugely involved with beauty product ethics but have stopped purchasing a few of my favorites (Benefit, CeraVe before 2017, Jeffree Star), usually after repeat offenses or just morally repugnant practices. However, many customers choose to overlook the actions of brands and once condemned brands, like Lime Crime, are now more popular than ever.

Do you just have to do your routine a little earlier to try to get it at least somewhat ""set""? Is there some way to prevent this tragedy, or am I just resigned to back sleeping? 

Thanks in advance for all your help! After joining this subreddit I've been a lot more motivated to take good care of my skin, and I'm really enjoying it so far!",878,176,asian_beauty
Magdar12468,"Before and After Pictures - [Before and After](https://m.imgur.com/a/QEdkE)


The first pictures were taken on 11/26/17 and the last 3 pictures were taken on 2/18/18. In the first pictures I was already sticking to my new AB routine for about a month. Its crazy because when I took the first pictures I took them because I was marveling at how much the redness had gone down in my face despite the few pimples I had. I took the updated pictures a couple of days ago to compare them to the older ones side by side just to see if there was much of a difference over the couple of months. 

Holy shit. I can't believe how much better my skin has gotten. After looking at the comparison, I can't believe my skin looks so fricken good. I can't believe its my skin tbh. 

I thought I would post this just to encourage anyone who is like me who used to hardcore believe in nothing but face scrubs, harsh actives, clay masks, and only a little bit of moisturizer to combat their acne. These people on this sub know wtf they're talking about. I will post a comment with my routine. 

Also if anyone has any advice for me it is much appreciated.",1135,211,asian_beauty

TherDerRinge,"[Review] Character Sheet Masks Review - I have been buying character masks as a fun way of sheet masking mostly because I realized it's better for my skin to have a stable, safe and boring routine. So I let myself have fun with masks.

I have never experienced a breakout from a mask as far as I can tell so I don't mind trying out all kinds of masks. Here I will review all the funny character masks I have bought and used since December 2017. I always buy two so I can be sure of my verdict.

Most of the masks are fine, some are HG status and the only ones I ""regret"" are the ones I gave 1 star. Other than that, they were still nice to use even if they get a low score. I rated them on a scale from 1-5, 5 being the best. The scale would be:

* 5: HG or HG-worthy mask. Fit must be very good, not an overwhelming smell, good hydration results and no thin, dripping essence.

* 4: One of the criteria from above did not perform as well, but otherwise a pretty good mask that I would still repurchase because I like it.

* 3: Mediocre mask that has some flaws that I prefer other masks over.

* 2: Something was very bad about the mask, like too strong artificial fragrance, a super runny essence, a very bad fit or else.

* 1: Why the hell do this things even get sold?!


This is an imgur album of all the mask with reviews seperately:¬†https://imgur.com/a/XpGBW

I have combo-oily skin. Here are the reviews for them all, the prices are what I found online today for one mask, I didn‚Äôt search around and compare prices, I just took the first search result. I‚Äôm sure you can find them cheaper somewhere if you want to:


**Holika Holika
Baby Pet Magic Sheet Mask Soothing Cat**

2.40 $

Perfect fit for my face, very hydrating, has a nice smell and lots of essence. Calms down redness very well.

5/5 HG


**Holika Holika
Baby Pet Magic Sheet Mask Whitening Seal**

2.40 $

Perfect fit for my face, hydrating, has a nice faint floral/sweet smell and a good essence consistency. The essence is the perfect amount - enough to be hydrating for 20 minutes without drying out, but not so much that you have to pat in leftover essence for 10 minutes straight. Brightens face for short term effects.

5/5 WRP


**Holika Holika
Baby Pet Magic Sheet Mask Vitality Panda**

2.40 $

Has a nice mild scent, perfect fit and a good essence consistency.

5/5 WRP
¬†

**The Face Shop
Star Wars Stormtrooper**

1.70 $

Fun to use, but a lot of waste with unuseful items (to me at least) like a very thick serum and WAY too much eye cream for one use. The sheet mask is very unique - it is silver on the outside and that side is pretty dry to the touch. On the inside the mask is wet and hydrating. The essence smells very refreshing. The mask is made out of two parts, one for the upper face and one for below the nose, so the fit is better than one piece masks. The parts are attached to an extra plastic piece which I find unnecessary. Would get 5 stars if it were only the mask without the waste of the other compartments and the extra plastic.

4/5 WNRP because of the other steps


**The Face Shop
Star Wars Darth Vader**

1.70 $

I'm bummed that this is only a black sheet mask and not a printed one or some kind of special fabric. The sheet fits my face very well. But oh god that sheet mask is very very heavily fragranced with a ""for men"" fragrance. It's almost like drenching my face in Axe. That's how horrible it was. The essence has a good consistency, so if you are into perfume masks, this is a good one.

1/5 WNRP


**The Face Shop
Character Sheet Mask Homer**

2.60 $

Worst fit ever. This mask is HUGE! The fabric of the sheet mask itself is very stiff, it doesn't adhere to my face. It smells a lot like artificial green tea, even though it's supposed to be drenched in olive extracts. There's not a lot of essence so the mask isn't all that hydrating. Literally everything about that mask was bad. Not even the print is all that vivid and it's weird.

1/5 WNRP


**The Cr√®me Shop
Wake Up, Skin**

4 $

Contains a lot of alcohol and smells accordingly, very thick sheet mask with a dripping, very runny essence.¬†

1/5 WNRP

**CLIV
Character Mask Penguin**¬†

3.80 $

Very heavily fragranced, smells like gummy bears. Hydrating, but bad fit.

2/5 WNRP¬†


**The Face Shop
Character Sheet Mask Marge**

2.60 $¬†

Same artificial green tea smell just like the Homer mask, although this is supposed to be drenched in a pomegranate essence. Same stiff sheet mask fabric, is a bit smaller than the Homer mask, but still doesn't fit my face at all and I had to cut it again.

1/5 WNRP


**SNP
Animal Dragon Soothing Mask**

1.60 $

Fits my face just ok, smells nice and hydrates well.

3/5 WNRP
¬†

**Urban Dollkiss
Dr. 119 Lovely Animal Collastin Mask Fox**

2.90 $

Very thick stiff sheet mask fabric, not a good fit on my face, never stuck to my face, smells good but frangranced. Not sticky afterwards.

2/5 WNRP


**SNP
Gentle Girl Mask Pack Macho Boy**

3.50 $

Good fit, smells ok, thick essence, nice sheet mask fabric, even though it's on the thicker side.

3/5 WNRP


**The Face Shop
Character Sheet Mask Lisa**

2.60 $

This only got one star more because it fits my face better than the other two variations. This mask is supposed to be infused with Hyaluronic Acid, but also smells like that artificial green tea scent. The sheet mask is also made of the same stiff fabric like the other two that doesn't adhere well to my face.

2/5 WRNP


**The Face Shop
Character Sheet Mask Dragon**

2.80 $

Smells a lot like green tea/mint but it's a pretty artificial one just like the Simpsons masks, fits my face just ok but the sheet mask is pretty stiff and doesn't adhere well to my face, pretty hydrating.

2/5 WRNP


**Dewytree
Wrinkle Keeper Tiger Mask**

1.90 $

The mask is very small and smells really bad like Superglue! Had to take it off after a few minutes.

1/5 WNRP


**Dewytree
Aqua Keeper Panda Mask**


1.90 $
¬†
Same as the Tiger one, bad fit, bad smell...

1/5 WNRP


**Tonymoly
Pok√©mon Sticker Sheet Mask**

3 $

There are twelve small sheet mask patches that show Pok√©mon faces as well as a Pok√©ball. You can stick them on all your dry areas wherever you want. It's really fun but also very unneccessary. I just stuck the extra sheet on my face to not let it go to waste. The essence is ok, not too runny not too dry with a floral scent. This thing is too gimmicky for me, so I wouldn't repurchase.

3/5 WNRP


**Mediheal
Mask Dress Dress Code Violet**

3 $

Heavily fragranced, good fit but that scent was too much for me.

2/5 WNRP


**BRTC
Make Over Mask PURITY**

3.80 $

Ok fit, smells good, pretty mediocre mask.

Not sticky, smells good but it's pretty fragranced. This is ok but there are more hydrating ones out there.

And two I don‚Äôt have pictures of:

**The Cr√®me Shop

Doesn't smell very good, tingled on my skin and burned in my eyes and on my eyelids when I put the flaps down.

**My Scheming

Very thin sheet, good fit, very runny and a lot of essence, smells very sweet, maybe a bit too fragranced.

StarCharism98,"[Research] Can someone please tell what happened to W2BEAUTY ? ..It's a very weird affair ! - Hello everyone !

Several months ago I ordered from W2beauty and at the very beginning I was so sceptical about the products 'cause I was not certain that they were original. 
So I contacted the ''chief'' of the site ( Alice ) and she told me that she buys all the products by herself directly in the shops in Korea, since she lives there.
Ok, so this site is a kind of personal blog which sells things.

Now, Alice is no longer here and this ''site'' is situated in LA and I asked to the customer service several questions about who is the chief now and how can they sell Korean products from the moment that Alice doesn't buy the item by herself anymore.

They don't answer to lot of questions and they told me that they are affiliate with all the brands they sell, so they are OFFICIAL RESELLER. 

It's all very weird and strange!

anaemiclittlepotato,"Washing off acids? - I was wondering this the other day. We all know that acid wait times are important because you need a low pH, and adding other products over the top would raise the pH. This would suggest that once you've applied products after your acid wait period, the acid is no longer having any effect. Therefore, would it make any difference if you washed it off?

I'm asking, because I hate the texture of my azelaic acid and it doesn't play well under my next layers. So I was wondering if applying it, waiting twenty minutes, then washing it off would be just as effective as leaving it on and applying serums etc over the top after twenty mins.

ocean_800,"[Review] Liah Yoo: Hemp Hydrating Cleanser - Just doing a quick review of this, I really like the product overall!:) Skin Type: Dry, dehydated &amp; acne prone, recovering from overexfoliation. 

**Price:**
$16 for 4oz not including shipping

Expensive for me, but I will talk more about this later. **3.5(?)/5**

**Ingredients** 

Ingredients list is pretty clean and it has hemp and matcha. I know some people were put off by the ""millennialy-ness"" of this product, but hemp and matcha are great for skin so idc. I literally use hemp seed oil every night in fact and that's what cured my chin acne soooo. Anyway, it's a cleanser so I think the 40% matcha it has is cool, but probably doesn't mean much. 

**Consistency/Fragrance:**

It doesn't smell at all, comes out like a gel. Feels like Cosrx Snail 96 honestly **5/5**

**Performance:** 
This cleanser is pretty gentle, which I love. For reference, some people consider the Cosrx Good Morning to be gentle, but that dried my face severely.

I would say the ""power"" of the cleanser is between Glossier Milky Jelly/Cerave Hydrating &lt; This &lt; Innisfree Bija Trouble Gel. It also doesn't leave ANY sort of residue which is great. I find that Milky Jelly gave me cysts with continuous use and that Cerave, while good left a sliiiiiiiight... ""feeling"" on my face. Not enough to bother, but this doesn't have any of that. The Bija itself isn't really drying on my skin, but in comparison is a tad more drying for me. If you have oiler/normal skin, you might not or probably won't even notice a difference.

 **4.5/5**


Bija Trouble gel is the closest in texture, but unlike that, this cleanser is foaming. I bring this up because due to its foaming nature you don't need a lot of this cleanser. This cleanser is the most expensive of all of the ones mentioned in the review, but it also requires the least amount every time i wash my face. In the mornings I use like half a dime, and the night half to full dime. This means that depending on how long this lasts, this might actually cheaper than both the Milky Jelly &amp; Bija, which are two of the most comparable cleansers imo. Other than that, it's a little hard to beat the price of Cerave haha.

**Rebuy?** 

Yes, as long as this lasts a long enough time. Its a great gentle cleanser that doesn't achieve anything astronomical, but it's the very mildness of it that makes it great. 

**Overall** 

4.5/5

* Do you target the fancyness to other parts of your body, where your skin is less finicky?

* Do you buy fancy perfume/scented candles / whatever to keep your hunger for newness satisfied?

* Have you been able to find products that are tolerable and still have that skincaretainment game going strong?

I'm thrilled to know how you deal with this!

I know I'm supposed to be talking about Asian beauty in this sub, but I'm very curious what Western brands/products you guys still use and find them irreplaceable. For me, I really love **Kiehl's**. Their products somehow work very well for my skin (25yo; super acne-prone, oily/combo but dehydrated) and I find myself going back to them whenever my skin freaks out trying new AB products.

aloneh95,"[Discussion] Dry + Acne Prone Skin Tips and Tricks - I did one of these a while back in r/SkincareAddiction, but I'm interested in seeing what the responses are for people with mostly AB routines. I feel like a lot of the time, people just give advice for oily acne-prone skin, and I sure as heck can't handle that many actives! So basically, this post is an opportunity to share hacks for dry skin and acne, and troubleshoot if something's not working. Make the most of it!

I've personally found that hydrating layers do wonders for my acne, but can still only do so much. I use an AHA every 3 days, and make sure to include a hydrating toner, HA serum, thick cream, and sleeping pack. This is working okay for moisture (I still want to add an essence and the Scinic AIO ampoule), but I definitely still have acne on my chin and CCs on my forehead, and am trying to figure out how to clear these two areas without drying/dehydrating my skin. Also, Dr. Jart Clearing Solution masks are my HG for balancing hydration with acne fighting. 

What is your favorite way to fight acne without drying out your skin? What are your HG products? Is there such a thing as ""too much moisture"" for you? I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences with this frustrating skin type!",1276,232,asian_beauty
kpack052,"[Discussion] so I really need to rave about the Purito brand - I never read anything about this Brand here so I just wanted to tell you guys about my Experience. 
 
So I First tried the Vitamin C serum and it was the first vitamin c serum wich didnt irritate my skin. It contains 10% vitamin C as well as hyualoronic acid and ginseng extract. I use it every morning and I finally unterstand the hype about vitamin C serums. 
 
I got a few samples of the centella cream and serum with the Vitamin C serum and honestly the green level centella cream is the best feeling cream I ever tried. Normally I dont use creams because I hated the feeling on my skin with every cream I tried so far also I am really sensitive to silicone and break out from almost every cream, but this sinks in in seconds and leaves a really nice hydrated and plump feeling.

When I saw that they just came out with centella pads (its like the cosrx pimple pads), I bought them instanly and they now pushed the cosrx pimple pads from their holy grail status.

The ph 5.5 cleanser is my new holy grail and dethroned the cosrx low ph cleanser. Its even gentler but still cleans the skin. And feels almost hydrating even though I wash it of.

the fermentation essence is now my ph balancing/ hydrating toner/first essence/7 skin layering toner and I dont even want to use my klairs toner and my missha essence any more. I just saved 3 steps in my routine.

By now almost my whole skin care routine are Purito Products and my skin changed from dehydrated, easy irritable with a really damaged skin barrier  to normal. I didnt have a pimple in weeks and my montly acne break out also dissapeared faster than ever. Also the redness on my cheeks and forehead really decreased.

They are so much more gentle on my tret-and-winter-tender face when I use them with cleansing water or my night toner (Son &amp; Park), and they don't seem to lock the product away like my drugstore cotton pads (although I do still use my fingers for the Klair's).

sprinklingsprinkles,"[Review] 4 Toner Review &amp; Comparison: Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner, Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner, Etude House Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner, Secret Key Aloe Soothing Toner - **Criteria**: Packaging, Ingredients, Smell, Texture, Effectiveness, Price Point

My skin type is dry and sensitive. I‚Äôm not acne prone it all, but I flush easily and my skin gets irritated by non-fatty alcohols. 

I want to forward this by saying that the Klais Toner and the Pyunkang Yul Toner are comparable to each other and the Etude House and Secret Key toners are comparable to each other as well. The first two are similar because they are meant to be hydrating and have a thicker consistency. The last two are both meant to be soothing and have a watery consistency. It depends what your preference are, really.

**Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner** 

**Packaging:** This toner comes in a semi-opaque round brown plastic bottle with a metal cap. Paired with the sticker it looks like it‚Äôs from a Victorian apothecary. I really like it‚Äòs unique look. The cap stays on while traveling and it never leaked. The semi-opaque bottle is slightly impractical because it‚Äôs hard to see how much product is left although not impossible. Kind of annoying though. 
The sticker is in English and Korean.

4 out of 5 

**Ingredients:**

Water, Butylene Glycol, Dimethyl Sulfone, Betaine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Disodium EDTA, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Polyquaternium-51, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Panthenol, Arginine, Luffa Cylindrica Fruit/Leaf/Stem Extract, Beta-Glucan, Althaea Rosea Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Lysine HCL, Proline, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Acetyl Methionine, Theanine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Copper Tripeptide-1

Positive are in my opinion the different plant extracts, especially Centella Asiatica and Licorice Root. Those are known to be soothing and have many other benefits. This toner has a pretty clean ingredients list and a good cosdna rating. The pH is ideal. 

The different oils that are used to create its smell can cause irritation or acne on some people though. Since this is a product that is supposed to work for people with sensitive skin I don‚Äôt understand why Klairs choose to include those. Be sure to patch test! 

3.5 out of 5

**Smell:** This product has a hanbang smell. It‚Äôs not that strong but not light either. It goes away shortly after applying the product. It smells pleasant to me if I‚Äôm not on shark week, it smelled nauseating to me then for some reason. I think my sense of smell was heightened because of hormones.

Since smell is very subjective I can‚Äôt say much more, I would recommend getting a sample if your nose is very sensitive. It has a natural kind of smell that is not perfume like.

4 out of 5

**Texture**: This has a nice texture. It‚Äôs definitely thicker than water but not too thick or sticky in my opinion. I like my toners to be on the thicker side since my skin is dry. If you want a watery toner I would choose something else.

5 out of 5

**Effectiveness**: ¬†This is a pretty hydrating product that you can layer as often as you want. It delivered hydration to my skin. ¬†¬†

It also claims to be soothing which it definitely wasn‚Äôt for me. I went through one bottle of this when I just started AB and didn‚Äôt know as well as now what my skin likes and what it doesn‚Äôt. It wasn‚Äôt outright stinging but it left my face slightly redder and irritated the sides of my nose which are pretty sensitive. When I used this again after some time I couldn‚Äôt believe I went through a full bottle of this. I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend it to people with sensitive skin now. Everyone‚Äôs experience is different though so get a decant or sample first if you‚Äôre prone to irritation or breakouts. Wishtrend sells little sample bottles of this for $5.

This didn‚Äôt break me out but then I‚Äôm not prone to irritation at all. I suspect the aloe extract to be the cause of the irritation but it could also have been the oils. 

I‚Äôm taking the hydrating effect in account for this rating, but the slight irritation and redness are a downer. Another plus is that it is supposed to be pH adjusting as well as hydrating.

2.5 out of 5

**Price point**: 180ml for $22 on Wishtrend

The price is okay in my opinion but compared to the other toner I‚Äôm going to show you it could be less. 

3 out of 5 

**Result**: 3.6 out of 5 (WNRP) ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

***

**Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner**

**Packaging**: I‚Äôve tried both sizes of this. They both come in a dark blue semi-opaque plastic bottle with a plastic cap. The smaller version has a screw on cap and the full size version has a flip open cap. With the white sticker it looks traditional, a bit like medicine but in a good way which goes with the brand (which‚Äôs background is traditional medicine). It looks pretty to me. ¬†¬†

The smaller version did leak while traveling, which is a let down. Make sure to have it stand upright. This could be improved. The full size version doesn‚Äôt leak in my experience though.

All in all, beautiful packaging but the smaller version's cap could be improved. The sticker is only in Korean but honestly I don‚Äôt mind. I don‚Äôt think you should expect English translations on everything, especially if you import products from another country. I don‚Äôt expect products to be in my mother tongue (German) either. 

This loses one point due to the leaking travel size version. 

4 out of 5

**Ingredients**:

Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine

Loving this ingredients list! Short and simple, perfectly suited for my sensitive skin. What can I say? Great job, Pyunkang Yul! A cosdna screenshot is included in the album.

5 out of 5

**Smell**: Good news for those with sensitive noses: I can‚Äôt smell anything at all! I don‚Äôt like to put perfumed products on my face so this is a big plus for me! Also great for all those with sensitive skin types.

5 out of 5

**Texture**: Very similar to the Klairs toner, feels slightly richer. I‚Äòve said before that I like that texture, so nothing much to say I didn‚Äôt say with Klairs toner. This might be too much for those with oily skin but it works perfectly for me! 

5 out of 5

**Effectiveness**: Don‚Äôt get me started about its effectiveness. This is insanely hydrating, soothing and really helps with my redness! Everything I want from a hydrating toner, honestly. This is the most effective toner for my skin concerns that I tried as of now and it‚Äôs reached holy grail status. Love all the way!

5 out of 5

**Price point**: $12 for 100ml and $18 for 200ml on RoseRoseShop's eBay

The smaller version is more expensive for the amount that you get but good for trying it out without paying the whole amount. Pretty good price point and a bit cheaper than the Klairs toner!

**Result**: 4.8 out of 5 (HG!)

**Etude House Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner**

**Packaging**: This comes in a clear plastic bottle with a white screw-on cap. ¬†The bottle is square instead of round. In my opinion it looks very pretty in a minimalist way. Again, I‚Äôve tried both the trial size and full size versions. They look the same, except that the plastic is not as clear in the small version. The writing is mostly in Korean. 

5 out of 5

**Ingredients**: WATER, PROPANEDIOL, GLYCERIN, BETAINE, PANTHENOL, MADECASSOSIDE, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS ROOT EXTRACT, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CARBOMER, POLYGLYCERIN-3, DISODIUM EDTA 

Like all Etude House Soon Jung products this has a clean ingredients list and is free of fragrance, alcohol and artificial colour. I really like that it contains madecassoside and camellia. This should be very well suited for sensitive skin. Also a pH of 5.5! Hooray!

5 out of 5

**Smell**: This doesn‚Äôt smell of anything. This is how I like it!

5 out of 5

**Texture**: This is a clear, watery product with a lightweight texture. I sinks into my skin immediately and feels exactly like water. 

5 out of 5

**Effectiveness**:  It never irritates my skin even if it‚Äôs already very irritated and red. It‚Äôs soothing and safe to use for me at anytime. I think it‚Äôs not meant to be a hydrating toner but it can be if you use several skins of it. This is perfect for the 7 skin method. Love!

5 out of 5

**Price Point**: 80ml trial size for $9, 180ml for $14 on Jolse

Reasonable price point although more expensive than the Secret Key Toner. 

4 out of 5

**Result**: 4.8 out of 5 (HG!)

***

**Secret Key Aloe Soothing Toner**

**Packaging**: This comes in a clear round plastic bottle with a large green sticker with the product‚Äôs benefits in cursive written on it. It‚Äôs a bit hard to read but in English (not perfect English, but English). It has a flip open cap. It looks okay if a bit cheap (well the product is cheap so I don‚Äôt think I can complain about that). It doesn‚Äôt leak. 

4 out of 5

**Ingredients**:

Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Aloe, Hyaluronic Acid, Beta Glucan, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Allantoin, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polysorbate 80, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Rose 

This is free of alcohol but has fragrance. Beneficial ingredients include aloe, hyaluronic acid and camellia. Looks good to me except for the fragrance. 

4 out of 5

**Smell**: I‚Äôm sorry to say that I don‚Äôt like the smell of this at all. I don‚Äôt know whether it is the aloe or the added fragrance. It‚Äôs not overpoweringly strong I guess but just urgh. 

2 out of 5

**Texture**: This has a runny, watery texture but feels a bit sticky. 

3.5 out of 5

**Effectiveness**: ¬†I bought this because Gothamista recommended it. I wanted it to be lightweight and soothing to use for the 7 skin method. Unfortunately, it turned my skin into an itchy red mess. I think I might be allergic to the aloe. That‚Äôs not the toner‚Äôs fault of course. 

I gave it to my roommate who has oily, somewhat acne-prone skin. It doesn‚Äôt irritate her face and she says it works okay. She wouldn‚Äôt repurchase though. I‚Äôm going to use her rating for this category because it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to rate it badly because of my allergy. 

3 out of 5 (according to my roommate)

**Price Point**: $10 for 248ml on Jolse

Well what can I say, this is dirt cheap! The bottle is huge. 

5 out of 5

**Result**: 3.5 out of 5 (WNRP)

***

**TLDR**: The Pyunkang Yul toner is the better thick, hydrating one and the Etude House Soon Jung toner is the better soothing, watery one.

2. Vermont - The Ecoskin shop. this one used to be inside The Glen but they have relocated because of the construction. You get discounts if you become a member.

soulsberry,"[Discussion] Warning about shady shipping practices / website errors (+ experience with sassy CS rep) - This is a long post (sorry) about a personal shopping experience I had this week, as well as a word of caution to fellow AB shoppers. I hope that if this is something you've never seen or caught before, that you can watch out for it!


### Basically (TLDR)

There are a number of AB stores that charge shipping by weight. Which is fine with me, but when I order from these stores, I am extra careful to make sure that the weight listed on each item is reasonable and fair. I've seen stores that have weird/inconsistent weight for certain items, driving up the shipping costs. Sometimes this is just a website error but... I don't care if your item is marked the cheapest on all of the internets; don't cheat me on shipping prices. Bill me correctly for shipping or just charge more for the actual item. I don't want to play games figuring out how much this item ACTUALLY costs.

That said, I want to share an experience I had with Cosmetic-Love. The experience and the email correspondence was kind of bizarre (as I'll detail below) but before I do share, I want to say that **they eventually went and fixed the problem**. (But never apologized!)

### The product and the problem

I want to share a specific example of this issue. I was browsing the Cosmetic-Love website when I came across a super discounted [Missha Seven Days Coloring Hair Treatment](https://cosmetic-love.com/products/missha-seven-days-coloring-hair-treatment-25ml), which is basically a small pouch of hair dye. It's usually ~$4 USD on Ebay so $1.64 is a steal! But... I've seen it in person. I've seen it in videos. It's not big. It's 25ml. Some single use face packs are 25ml. It's not even for the whole head, it's like for doing home-bre tips. But then I noticed that when I put different colors in my shopping cart, the weight was different depending on the color. This is what you saw when you put them in the cart:

- #01 Gold Yellow = 232 g
- #02 Lavender Purple = 211 g
- #03 Red Orange = 189 g
- #04 Smoke Blue = 183 g
- #05 Cherry Red = 214 g
- #06 Khaki Green = 249 g
- #07 Pink Brown = 29 g (only reasonable one)

(Note: they have now been fixed at 45 g each. I don't want to upload screenshots of every item but [here's one of the website that I took last night.](https://imgur.com/a/hsXTY))

It didn't feel right that this product had different weights depending on the color, and it especially didn't feel right that it could possibly weigh 200+ grams. Every other store I looked up listed this item at somewhere between 30-60 grams (which sounds about right).

This means that hypothetically, if I buy one of each of the 7 colors, shipping comes out to 1.307 kg total (WOW) = $16.34 for the cheapest shipping option. If I buy 7 of the #07 Pink Brown, which was the only color weighed normally, shipping comes out to 203 g = $3.97 for the cheapest option. That's a difference of $12.37 that I could be cheated out of in shipping cost. Are you kidding me?

Now $11.48 (for all 7 colors of this product) + $16.34 (for shipping) = $27.82 , which means $3.97 per product. I understand that this is a **reasonable** price, and similar to other retailers. But then why can't their actual price reflect that? **Why am I being led to believe that I'm getting a steal with each hair dye at $1.64+shipping, when actual shipping cost is being marked up 300%?**


### The correspondence

Regardless of whether this is plain shadiness or just an honest mistake, they should fix it. So I notified Cosmetic-Love with the issue, and they asked me for screenshots, which I provided. I was kind of alarmed because this is the response I got after sending screenshots and explaining the problem with the shopping cart and the different product weights:

&gt;our website is fine

&gt;which is that?

Uhhhhhh haha. What. Are you asking me... which website this is? These screenshots? It's... yours? I'm so confused. You're not even bothering to check the problem by putting the items in your shopping cart like I told you about and you're going to claim that there's nothing wrong with your website? Or are we having a language barrier problem here? Hmm...

I sent them screenshots again of their whole website including their logo and their url, along with this: (Note that at this point, after already having explained the problem multiple times, my understanding is that they are claiming that there is nothing wrong with their website and will not do anything to fix it.)

&gt;No, these pictures are from your website, Cosmetic-Love.com. I'm getting different weights on different colors of the same product. If you don't have an explanation for this, then I won't be purchasing from your store ever again. Have a nice day.

I've purchased from their Ebay store before and it was fine. But suddenly I have no desire to buy anything from them anymore lol. Here's the reply I got:

&gt;oops seems like you are threatening me

&gt;I think that is a system error, we will go over it

WHAT IS GOING ON LOL I'm so confused....... I... threatened her??? Guys should I feel bad? I'm sorry that I don't want to shop from what it seems like a shady and non-apologetic dealer. Anyone else had this kind of experience with any AB customer service before? This is definitely unusual for me.......

Anyway good news is, as of a few hours ago, they fixed the issue on this product and now all the colors are listed at 45 g. Their last reply:

&gt; we changed 

&gt; you can see again

&gt; regards,

Thanks Cosmetic-Love for fixing the problem quickly, and also for the funny/bizarre/annoying/perplexing customer service experience. If something like this happens again, I hope you can just apologize and say you'll take care of the problem.


### Conclusion

If you ever notice similar things, I suggest you notify the store right away so that they can get it fixed!

eraser_dust,"[Review] Berrisom Lip Tints are created by a sadistic monster. - Ok, this is more of a rant than a review, but I'm just so irrationally angry right now. 

So I remember reading about Berrisom peel off lip tints a year ago, and the reviews generally mention how cool and affordable they were. One of my friends told me they were the best selling K-Beauty product in Malaysia, so I bought them on impulse when they were on sale. 

Either my friend was sorely mistaken, or there's one sadistic psycho who derives pleasure in torturing people buying them in bulk.

Let me take you through the bullshit application process first....

First, it's like applying Elmer's glue on your lips. It's hard to get an even layer and the edges get patchy as they dry as you apply. At the same time, the middle bit? They never dry fully, even after 5 minutes, because your saliva keeps it wet. And I have Sj√∂gren's, a disease that *keeps my mouth bone dry*, so I have no idea what it'll be like for normal people. 

So it takes 5 minutes for *most* of it to dry. **WHO THE HELL HAS 5 MINUTES TO WAIT FOR THEIR LIPSTICK TO DRY???**


Oh, and the scent. You know how those ""fruit-scented"" plastic toys we had as kids always had that cloyingly artificial scent? Now imagine setting them on fire and mixing the scent of melting plastic in. That's how these smell like. Various shades of melted plastic.

If you get them on your teeth, you're going to have to rebrush your teeth because just wiping them off with a tissue won't work.

Certain colours also sting as you wait for them to dry. I **[legit started tearing](https://youtu.be/qkHui8nN25U?t=15m44s)** while doing a swatch video. 

Oh, and they leave this gross, sour, acrid taste on your lips. You know how dentists put acid on your cavities to really clean them before putting in the filling? **THAT** taste. 

After all that shit, you would at least expect it to be long lasting. Nope. It faded in patches in less than 4h, before I even ate anything or drank anything other than water. **WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BULLSHIT???** After everything I've been through, I expect this shit to be not just bulletproof, but *nuclear bomb proof*. As in, when the nuclear holocaust comes along and I have to eat my husband for survival, my lips are still a lovely shade of pink and I gnaw on his remains. 

Did I mention that since it's hard to get an even layer on, the stain left behind ends up looking patchy? It looks like I just bit my lips and they're lovingly stained with *blood*. In fact, I think I'd have a more pleasant experience if I just bit my lips and used my own blood as a lip stain. 

**FUCK YOU BERRISOM.**

jaderavenclaw,"[Discussion] Let's talk amounts. Literally, how much product do you use? - So maybe weird. I sort of find non-interesting things interesting and I'm interested in the amount of each of your products you actually use. The literal physical amounts. 

Honestly, sometimes I wonder if a product is more effective or less effective for someone because of the amount used. Or if something, like actives, irritates someone more than someone else because they're using too much of the product (of course I know YMMV).

For example my current routine for when my skin is irritated/dry by this cold harsh weather:

Rinse face with water in AM/PM use Bioderma (have no exact amount, just whatever is needed to remove whatever I'm wearing) to remove sunscreen/MU.

-Use about a tablespoon or two of honey. Leave on for five minutes, wash off.

-Huxley extract it toner. 3-4 shakes/drops per layer. Four layers.

-Kiku high moist. 2 pumps per layer. 1 pump is like a water quarter sized splash haha. 2 layers.

-Two pumps (pumps out about a pea sized drop) of Cosrx snail mucin to cover my face.

-Pea sized amount of Dr. Jart Cicapair Mask in the AM/Pea sized amount of Dr. Jart Cicapair cream+three drops of Squalane for PM.

-Vaseline at night to occlude everything.

I typically use Vit C also but I've stopped this past week and a half because the weather is drying out my skin super bad, but when I do I use three drops of Mad Hippie Vit C serum.

Also another random amount thing I'm interested in, if you use clay masks or wash off masks, how much do you use? Do you slather it on so it's a thick layer or just use barely enough to coat skin. This was a random thing I noticed when I was with my cousin. We were putting on the Lush MoM mask and I just slathered it on, whereas she literally put the thinnest layer possible on her face.
 
*Another* thing that I'm pondering on is the amount of something used before it it has a negative effect. I couldn't use sheet masks more than a few times a week because they would end up clogging my pores but I just discovered the Leaders 7 Wonders Acai masks and I've used it four times in a row and my skin has responded beautifully. I know some people only use sleep masks a few times a week otherwise their pores clog too. Is there anything in your routine you can only use a few times/a certain amount, otherwise it's not as effective?",2374,433,asian_beauty

**[Mask &amp; Chill Sheet Mask Store/Bundle Review](http://malaysianbeautyhaul.blogspot.my/2017/10/store-review-mask-chill-sheet-mask.html)**

Purchased. Full disclosure, I know about this shop because two of my wonderful fellow sheet mask addicts here in Malaysia are the founders. When they told me they were offering their own sheet mask bundle, what choice did I have other than to GRAB ONE FOR MYSELF. They're doing a sheet mask bundle of 5 masks for RM30 on shopee for Malaysians, or $10 for non-Malaysians with free shipping. Tracking would add an additional $1. 

Here's what you can get (one from each tier): Tier 1: Lherboflore/Ultru/Bonvivant/Abybom Tier 2: Kpop maskTier 3: Always21/Etude House/CellpiumTier 4: LoveRecipe/BeyondTier 5: My Beauty Diary

I purchased a bundle from their shopee store and I received a Forensco 7 day mask (caviar), Cellpium mask, Bonivant, Beyond Herb Garden, and My Beauty Diary Royal Pearl Mask, all of which I'm ecstatic about!

[**Gobdigoun Aging Corrector Skin Milk Conditioner &amp; 7 Skin Method**](http://malaysianbeautyhaul.blogspot.my/2017/10/gobdigoun-review-gobdigoun-aging.html)

Provided by Gobdigoun: This Skin Milk Conditioner is sent to me for my honest review, but all thoughts are my own. Gobdigoun is a Korean skincare brand that has been around since 2010 and produces high quality and middle to higher price ranged products. The main ingredients in the product include Niacimamide, Goat Milk Extract, Licorice Root Extract, Oatmeal Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Olive Leaf Extract, Ceramide.

The texture for this is quite watery (like a toner) and it feels absolutely heavenly on my skin. Instant softness. T.T I tried the 7 skin method according to their recommendation. It's 2 layers for oily skin, 4 for normal, and 7 for dry skin. I have oily/combo skin, so 3 layers was about right for me. My skin was so, so soft afterwards. T.T I kind of love this and hate that I love this because it's a whooping 44,000 won. Thankfully, they have plenty of discounts and sets available over at their[ instagram](https://www.instagram.com/Gobdigoun9/) and [facebook.](https://www.facebook.com/GobdigounEnglish) Guess I better start saving up.

[**Swanicoco A.C. Control Care Skin Toner**](http://malaysianbeautyhaul.blogspot.my/2017/09/swanicoco-review-swanicoco-ac-control.html)

Provided by Swanicoco: I received this in exchange for my honest review. ^ ^ Swanicoco is a South Korean cosmetic company that has been around since 2005 and prides itself for it's patented raw component and nano-fermented formulations, using natural extracts in it's products. They launched in Malaysia Watson store recently.

The A.C. Care line specializes in acne treatment and it's special formula balances out water and oil on the skin, leaving the skin fully moisturized afterwards. It is made with natural and organic ingredients. I have been using this for more than five months now and actually enjoy this enough to have backup ready already. I predict about 1-2 more months before I run out, which means this bottle can last for about 7-8 months, which is really pretty amazing! This Swanicoco Toner is one of the few products that has remained on my routine even through breakouts and painful pimples. This doesn't sting my skin, even when I'm breaking out actively. T.T

[**Orgavalley OV In Nature 24 Nutritive Deep Cleanser 120**](http://malaysianbeautyhaul.blogspot.my/2017/08/orgavalley-review-orgavalley-ov-in.html)

Provided by BBCosmetic: I received this from [BBCosmetic](http://bbcosmetic.com/) in exchange for my honest review. My code still works for an additional 8% off everything in their store by the way! C10T190S. I don't get anything if you use the code but you get a discount. ^ ^ Orgavalley is a relatively new name in the game of korean skincare. It focuses on natural ingredients and traditional fermentation with the modern nano-technology. Orgavalley is free from chemicals and focuses on minimal ingredients in it's products. At the price point of $34, it puts the cleanser with the higher end brands. Ingredients are only water, olive oil, Rosemary leaf water, Peppermint leaf water, Aloe ferox leaf extract, lavender leaf extract, glycerin, potassium hydroxide, Lavender oil, lemongrass oil.

The cleanser is quite high pH, sadly. It can't remove all makeup either, so it's actually quite mild. Almost a month into using this, my skin healed really well. The red, inflamed parts of my skin have gotten better, no more new pimples, and my skin is just slowly healing from the many breakouts. Ahh. Thank goodness. I've been struggling with the painful skin irritation for a few weeks prior to introducing this product and this really helped.

[**Tia'm My Signature C Source Serum**](http://malaysianbeautyhaul.blogspot.my/2017/07/vitamin-c-review-tiam-my-signature-c.html)

Won from instagram contest! :D [This product](http://bbcosmetic.com/tiam-ost-my-signature-c-source-serum-30ml/) was previously O.S.T. C20. Nothing has changed other than that. The only thing that's changed is the name. The product and ingredients, production line and I'm assuming even the people responsible for making these are the same. Tia'm kindly informed me that the reason for the name change is because people (me included) frequently mistake O.S.T. C20 for By Wishtrend, which are actually completely different.  In addition, there's an issue of trademark rights about C20 in the US, so the name change was necessary in order to extend the product line. I'm really pleased Tia'm is transparent about that. ^ ^ I purchased their [C21.5](http://malaysianbeautyhaul.blogspot.my/2016/09/review-ost-c20-pure-vitamin-c215.html) before and have purchased a few C20, but the Tia'm bottle was won during one of their giveaways.",6056,883,asian_beauty

doubleaa12324,"[Discussion] Best products for improving overexfoliated, damaged, terribly textured skin? - Long story short, around 7 months ago I wrecked my skin through harsh masks, harsh cleansers and harsh exfoliants. 

I‚Äôve been learning a lot from this sub and I see the Cosrx 95 galactomyce essence alongside the snail mucin essence as being very good for skin repair. But my specific problem is that my skin has very shitty texture ever since me ruining it with the masks so would this make a difference? If not, what would be better that isnt a chemical exfoliant because the last thing I want to do is somehow make it worse.

Vyarra,"[Discussion] Subscription Boxes (current)- reviews please !Those to try, consider, avoid! - Hi everyone,

I was wondering what people's recent experiences have been with AB Subscription boxes. Like many people, I enjoy surprises in the mail and trying new beauty products. I recently discontinued my Mishibox subscription after about 5 months and am looking for another one. Mishibox overall was good- mix of brands- some well known others not, some full size products, always a sheet mash. However, recently I feel like they started including more makeup and accessories (hand mirror- no thanks) and I'm not really interested in gold eyeshadow and generic black liner. So, anyone have any good reviews on a sub box that has thrilled them? Or a terrible one that should be avoided ?",783,128,asian_beauty

Ones_Fate,"[Discussion] Update on purchase from Sweet Corea - So I just wanted to post an update since I just received my Sweet Corea order. I picked the cheapest shipping option at around 11 dollars, items shipped on the 10th, I received it on the 16th. That is so insane! I've never had any overseas orders arrive that fast! Some Domestic US packages don't even arrive in that short of time.

I was worried that the products weren't authentic because they we're so cheap but I have absolutely no concerns they are fake. In fact the LJH Ampoule has the same lot number and expiration date as the one I just ordered from Target. Packaging looks exactly the same, with the same texture, clear sticker sealing the item and inside information. Product smells the same and feels the same. 

I did get kind of a skimpy sample of just one small packet but oh well :/

This was such a steal at 9 dollars a bottle. I'm giddy! The only thing I wish was that I ordered more items! I think this will be my go to shop for K Beauty!

babegeous,"[Discussion] Shaving Ideas - Newbie here, looking for suggestions! My husband has shown some interest in r/skincareaddiction, but hasn't done a lot of digging or anything. He didn't know about r/AsianBeauty until I showed him, and I don't know that he has the motive to try establishing a routine on his own. His skin has improved somewhat over the past year or two, so I think he might've given up on it a little, or just accepted it for what it is.

I'm still learning, but I've gotten really interested in skincare, and I'd like to help him if I can. He has to shave every day for work, and he uses cheap shaving cream and razors because it works best from what he's found. I figure changing his shaving routine is a good place to start. He tends to be oily and somewhat acne-prone, but I'm convinced that his skin is dehydrated as well, and resolving that would help to balance things out.

I've been looking through a few threads, but honestly it's a little hard to find things regarding facial shaving. So far I've found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5vwzuo/discussion_men_of_ab_what_shaving_cream_do_you/de5pzrz) by /u/playpirates that piqued my interest. I think using a non-comedogenic oil, or maybe a gentle moisturizing cleanser could be a good idea. I think using a snail goo product to soothe the skin is brilliant and I'm definitely interested in trying that, but I'm not sure what to try.

petitoignon,"[Discussion] Beauty Media Coverage of K-Beauty, Asian Beauty - I've noticed this recurring trend myself but the last week there have been atleast 3 instances that I've rolled my eyes so far back in my head I thought they'd fall out.

It's great that K-Beauty and other Asian Skincare practices are becoming more mainstream in the US and other Western countries. It allows for more people to have access to the products we know and love and introduces a new type of self care, education, and understanding to skincare to the masses. That being said...I'm really just disgruntled about these 'articles' claiming miracles with no context and borderline careless advice. Some examples below:

---
#####Marie Claire, [""These 5 Cult-Favorite Korean Skincare Products Will Truly Give You The Best Skin of Your Life""](https://donotlink.it/bY4K )

Not only does this post **NOT** include a second cleanser after the cleansing balm, it comes across as very snooty and like these products are somehow the catch all cure to yield perfect skin. When I see articles like this, it tells me the author did absolutely zero research into Korean skincare and AB because there is no YMMV! Throwing in acids like it's just the thing to do had me like O_O and I can't help but feel like these seemingly reputable publications need content producers and writers who are actually educated...(can some of y'all freelance there?!)


#####Bustle, [""Too Cool For School's Pumpkin Skin Care Products Will Get Your Face Ready For Fall""](https://donotlink.it/wnko) 

A general overview of TCFS at Sephora. Nothing wild but it gave way to...

#####Refinery29, [""You Can Now Add Pumpkin Spice To Your Skin Care Routine, Because What Better Way To Celebrate Fall?""](https://donotlink.it/QkEE) 

Y'all this article came to my attention from someone I follow on IG. In fact [her post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYeTQwegAHN/?taken-by=dat_seoul_glow) is what prompted me to write this because I'm just so smh! The article is misleading on 2 major levels. 

1. It says the TCFS product is new (it isn't, it's been since 2015 if not earlier), 
2. Touts the sleeping pack as pumpkin spice...anyone who has tried the mask would no that it is actually very floral and to ME doesn't even smell like pumpkin let alone give me fall season vibes and I love fall
3. A bonus third is: if all these publications are beauty based, couldn't they atleast TRY the products and give accurate reviews? It's totally misleading and lazy. I personally expect more.


#####Health, [""The Surprising Korean Beauty Product That Transformed My Skin""](https://donotlink.it/Vl0a)

This author describes their experience with ONE product and how it affected their routine. It also seems that it was introduced as part of the person's skincare overhaul and they describe how they introduced the essence into the routine. Overall I thought this was a decent article and not misleading to the masses. Ideally, there would be more nuance ie describing her skin type or skin concerns but at this point my bar is so low that this is not bad!

#####PopSugar, [""Your Favorite Stores Are Making 1 Major Mistake With K-Beauty""](https://donotlink.it/m1Rv)

Well this is strangely meta.

KillingPerfection,"[Discussion] Anyone else here suffering from severe acne due to birth control pills? Lets discuss hormonal acne and what helps. - I never really had a proper skincare routine till i switched to AB. Within a month of starting AB, people started to notice a difference in my skin and complemented me for it. For the first time in years, i had a smooth almost-baby like soft skin, and i couldnt be happier.
This was at the time that i was off my birth control pill for 6 months after being on it for 1 year. I was feeling better than ever. Then my boyfriend came back and I decided to go back to my old birth control pill.
I was trying out the stratia liquid gold at that time when i first noticed a few big cystic acne on my face. I thought it was being caused by the liquid gold and stopped it immediately. I switched to trying a new sunscreen and the acne just grew worse. I thought it was being caused by the chemical filters in the sunscreen, and i went back to my old sunscreen. I never thought that the pill could be the culprit because i was on it for a year and never had problems with my skin.
I went back to my most trusted skincare routine of cleansing with the face shop light oil followed by cosrx low ph, cosrx galactomyces essence and cosrx rice moisturiser. These were HG for me because these never broke me out. But i noticed my acne getting worse, to the point that my face, that was once smooth and soft, was now sore and bumpy.
Thats when i realised that it could be something caused by the pill. I went to my gynaecologist immediately and he prescribed a new pill that fights acne and improves skin, but i had to finish the current packet i was taking. My skin got crazy bad and when i started the new pill, it didnt get any better. Thats when i decided to visit a dermatologist.
She gave me antibiotics called Minocyclin and a tretinoin cream to apply on the acne and told me that even the new birth control will take 4 months to work on acne. Currently i am 2 weeks into taking monocyclin and my skin looks horrible. The acne inflammation has gone down and it doesnt hurt as much as it did before, but gosssshhhh, it looks so bad!!!
I dont feel like even stepping out of the house, the only way i do so is after applying makeup, but those bumps still stick out! People who once gave me compliments for my skin, now pass extremely mean comments to me, telling me how bad my face looks. This is a new low i guess, but all i can do now is to have patience.
Is there anyone who had the same problems? I have heard of people getting acne after getting off the pill, but the pill causing acne is something that was new to me. Is there an AB routine for hormonal acne that anyone here has tried and that has helped them?",2734,529,asian_beauty

I'm slowly diving into Asian beauty and am now on the market for eye patches!

Problem areas: dark circles which may be allergy shiners or hereditary, dryness  (no matter how much moisturizer I use for my under eyes,  it drinks it all up - and yes,  I do drink enough water) Also, looking for something to help regain some volume under my eyes to make them not look sunken in

happycharm,"[Discussion] Which Japanese Skincare Beats Korean Skincare? - I live in Korea so I am surrounded by amazing Korean skincare on a daily basis. 

I also find that Korean packaging is so much cuter or nicer than Japanese packaging (of course this is different depending on what your ~aesthetic~ is). 

As a result, Japanese skincare hasn't sparked any interest in me... 

I know as a general rule of thumb a lot of Japanese mascaras are better than Korean ones (but I don't wear much makeup so I have been apathetic about Japanese makeup) and Japanese sunscreen are better than Korean ones (but there tends to be alcohol in most Japanese sunscreens and there's the controversy if Biore and Nivea in the realm of Asian beauty). 

The cute/pretty packaged items in Japan are usually really expensive (for example, Liz Lisa) and usually for makeup whereas for in Korea, you can get cute/nice packaging for almost any type of skincare. 

Please change my mind and tell me what are some superior Japanese skincare products! Comparing it to some Korean equivalents would be interesting. And I think you can tell you can win me over with cute packaging.",1144,195,asian_beauty

nikarphar,"[Discussion] Post your experiences on popular sunscreens here. Biore, Shiseido,Missha,La Roche Posay etc - I thought we would start a thread in which everyone can post their experiences with popular or unpopular sunscreens as most of the info gets scattered in various threads.Here is my experience after trying some 35+ brands I have light olive NC20 skin that tans SUPER fast when exposed to sun. I don't have a tendency to burn so a tan is the way I can judge effectiveness.


Avene very high protection from Europe
..very very good.no tan as far as I can see from 20-30 mins exposure 3 days / week or so. I still layer with shiseido as i am paranoid about tanning.worked very well at the beach

Shisedo Anessa 
seems pretty good. no white cast still you can tan after long periods i.e 30 mins or more in the sun. 

Shiseido babies n children spf 42.. 
seems the bombproof one but the white cast is insane still would use for water activities or sports. white cast is not that noticeable if your skin is NC20 or lighter

La Roche posay.(European)
also very good in preventing a tan or burn however I would still layer 

Bioderma photoderm..(European)
 Layered with a zinc sunscreen seems to be a good one for outdoor activities.

Heliocare tablets..
Seem to work in conjunction with sunscreen but I've read reviews in which it seems it darkens people quicker. I could see a light gold color in my face on the days I took them so I stopped. I'm still on the fence about them

Lancer sunscreen.
 I love it but not for intense sun, for winter use only.

Cotz Sensitive with zinc 20%

Actually pretty nice,the white cast might be too much for some people good protection.


The Ones that do not work for me

Neutrogena for face spf 55... made my skin burn and eyes water


Cotz spf 40 lovely finish but not very effective tanned quick with it .

Clinique city block spf 40..made me the most tan I have ever been in my life in the 2 months I used it.

Badger spf 30 zinc... made me 3 shades darker in hawaii in 4 days.

Biore watery essence.. complete fail made me tan faster almost like not wearing anything.

Shiseido Urban enviornment .. Surprisingly made me tan very very fast  with only 15 mins of exposure a day in one week during a kentucky trip.not sure maybe the alcohol is not good for my skin? I tanned 2 shades and it took almost a month to get rid of it

Missha. Surprisingly not very effective unless i layer it was a zinc sunscreen.

Biore Milk. another one that made me tan slightly.

Uriage Bariesun. Just ok not too bad but very greasy and hard to wear

Straight Desitin..40% zinc darkened me quicker than having nothing on my face..not sure of the reason.

Elta MD another fail, tanned super quick with it.

LadyBanterbury,"[REVIEW] Meishoku Ceracolla Perfect Gel - Skin type: Dry, very sensitive and ocassionally acne prone skin. 

First impressions: It comes in a big 90g tub. The packaging on the outside has a baby's face on it?? The actual tub has a teardop on it. I got it off Yesstyle for about 11 pounds. It took about three weeks to get to my house. I use a spatula from a dead cosrx cream to scoop up the product. 

Special ingredients: three different types of ceramides,  nano collagen and hyaluronic acid. 


Here is a cosdna of the ingredient list - http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_6d70176571.html

My thoughts: The gel cream is thick to the touch and sinks in after a couple of minutes. The gel cream goes back to its original shape after you use it like a memory foam pillow. No fragrance detected. I apply this to a damp face and then apply my occlusive cream on top.  It gives me that smooth baby skin which is ironic haha. I like it so far - using it for a week now. If I'm honest, I was skeptical to try this due to the temperamental nature of my skin but this is a beautiful gel cream. It kind of reminds me of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel cream but the better ceramide packed version. People have complimented me on my skin - one customer asked me what highlight I was using when it was just my skincare.

Personally, I just got my first haul of AB products. Excited to try it out. I also started wet shaving last month as my electric razor was shitting the bed. My wet shave routine:

1. Lather and soup up face with Omega Crema da Barba Shaving Cream
2. Shave with Safety Razor
3. Use Armani Code After Shave Balm

That's essentially my face routine right now. No real ill effects, in fact my skin feels smoother after this routine. And I'm happy with the shave.

Now I purchased and just received all my new AB products. Never used any of them before, excited to try. I don't know where to fit the Shaving Routine into my AB routine. 

Here's my planned AB skin care routine. (Please let me know how it looks and the order as I am new to this):

1. Oil Cleanser: Banila Co Clean It Zero Purity
2. Foam Cleanser: CosRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser
3. Toner: Klairs Supple Preparations Facial Toner
4. Essence/Serum: CosRX Advanced Snail 92 All in One Cream
5. Moisturizer: CosRX Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap
6. Suncream: Klairs Mid-Day Blue Sun Lotion

7. Overnight Treatment: MIZON Acence Blemish Out Pink Spot 

So my plan is to do my normal shaving cream/after shave routine. Then clean it all off with the Oil, then Foam based cleaner and just go at the AB stuff. Would this work?

_ **Bioderma Micellar water**(I have super sensitive skin)
_ **klairs SP toner** ( I'm trying to layering it)

_ Dermon sp50 sunscreen

Maria197180,"[REVIEW] First Impression: **THE HISTORY OF WHOO Gongjinhyang Yeol : White Clay mask** - My skin is rather sensitive and very dry, so I am struggling with finding a balance between hydrating (which is the main focus of the products I buy) versus not clogging my skin or weighing it down too heavily with products.  I already use Obagi and Retinol for treating Melasma and although I realize that these two may be baby acids, they really do a number on my skin, so I CANNOT do any more acids or harsh exfoliants to try to clarify or detoxify my skin. Therefore, I thought that clay masks may be the way to go. 

The first clay mask I bought was *Borghese Fango Delicato* and that was a bit drying for me. I've also used *Belif Peat Mask* and have used it multiple times since my first review. It's a VERY good mask: it cleans, exfoliates slightly, and doesn't irritate my skin. I saw a blog review of The History of Whoo's white clay mask and I thought, ""why not, let's try this one?"" (the review was very positive) 

Anyway, to make a long story short, I tried it last night and here are my impressions: 

1) The Item itself: here's the amazon link if you want to take a look at it: https://www.amazon.com/History-Whoo-Gongjinhyang-Yeol-White/dp/B00VBGJ15C

2) The consistency: This surprised me. As you can see, it comes in a tube, not a tub or jar. Although this is more sanitary, I think you get A LOT less product. Anyway, the consistency was almost like-a cold cream. The box contains it's own brush but honestly, I have no idea why because the only way I could put it on was with my hands. It's too soft for a brush, IMO. The mask is white-ish with like a pinkish undertone? It's hard to explain. You don't need a lot of product to cover your face.

3) The scent: Ummmm... I kept trying to discern one but it's not in your nose hanbangy at all. More like skin-care ish smell. A bit musty but really, it wasn't strong enough to register. 

4) How did it feel on my face? Honestly, you get a burn. Not a tingle, but an honest-to-goodness legit burn. Not jalapeno pepper burn, but ancho chile burn. The burn dissipates eventually to more of a hum and then nothing, but at the beginning I actually wanted to take it off. I was worried it was going to leave a rash or dry out my face. 

I left the mask on for about 20 minutes because I wanted to see how long it would take for it to dry out. This is the odd part. It doesn't dry like a traditional clay mask-i.e. it doesn't crack or feel tight. The only indications that it was dry were that none of the product came off when I lightly touched it and the tingling stopped. It comes off easily with warm water and a washcloth. 

5) The effects: Well. First, my skin felt sensitive. Like one feels after a good massage. Sort of sore and achy but in a good way. My face was red overall but I didn't get a rash or a bad reaction. And Fuck if my face wasn't clean. I mean, SERIOUSLY clean. It looked poreless. It felt poreless. It didn't feel dry at all. JUST VERY, intensely clean. It was a Belif mask and Borghese Fango x 10. I kept waiting for a bad reaction but didn't get one. 

I paired this up with an SKII sheet mask and did my nightly routine and listen-for the first time since I started AB I can honestly say-I GET what the glow and brightness is all about. I looked at my face in the bathroom at work-which usually turns humans into zombie-like beings and my skin looks good even with that lighting. 

6) Would I repurchase-ABSOLUTELY.

milk_tea_way,"[Review] Shiseido Perfect UV Protector SPF50+ PA++++ WetForce HydroFresh - [Shiseido Perfect UV Protector SPF50+ PA++++ WetForce HydroFresh](http://imgur.com/a/JHzce)

Maybe it's just me and my few loose screws, but as an owner of relatively sensitive skin, sometimes I get bored by my own skin and consciously go for something that would probably kill my skin (but perhaps not!).  This review was born out of such an occasion.

Let's get everything out of the way, shall we? Here are the reasons why, on a normal day, I would run for the hills and away from this sunscreen:

- high ethanol content,

- fragranced, and

- mentholated.

And yet, here I am.  The plan was to test this sunscreen out for exactly a week, before moving on to the other sunscreens languishing in my stash (a NOV and a Coppertone).  It has been a little bit over a week, and I've still got my claws sunk deep in this sunscreen.

---

*General Information*

Shiseido *Perfect UV Protector SPF50+ PA++++ WetForce HydroFresh* is a waterproof, mentholated sunscreen, containing both organic and inorganic UV filters.  It costs JPY 4,500 for 50 mL of product.

This sunscreen is a variant of the *Perfect UV Protector WetForce* (*HydroFresh* refers to its cooling property).

*Ingredients*

Water, **zinc oxide**, ethanol, isododecane, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate **(octinoxate)**, caprylyl methicone, butylene glycol, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine **(Tinosorb S)**, sucrose stearate, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, dimethicone, silica, ethylhexyl triazone **(Uvinul T 150)**, dextrin palmitate, xylitol, diethylhexyl succinate, menthol, menthyl lactate, nylon-12, PEG/PPG-14/7 dimethyl ether, thiotaurine, *Saxifraga stolonifera* extract, royal jelly extract (1), *Sophora angustifolia* root extract, PPG-17, isostearic acid, triethoxy capryllysilanedistearyl dimonium chloride, (dimethylacrylamide/sodium acryloyldimethyltaurate) crosspolymer , sorbitan sesquiisostearate, succinoglycan, cellulose gum, citric acid, butylated hydroxytoluene, tocopherol, trisodium EDTA, stearic acid, sodium pyrosulfite, sodium citrate, *Syzygium jambos* leaf extract, fragrance.

---
 
The *WetForce HydroFresh* is an off-white, slightly thick liquid.  It spreads easily and sinks in quickly, although it is not instantaneous.  I detect no white cast on my NC20-25 skin.  The finish is skin-like.  In this warm and humid weather, the sunscreen is far from drying; however, I have no idea how it will perform in drier and colder months.  It is relatively lightweight: not as weightless as the old Biore *Watery Essence* formulation, but slightly lighter than Acseine *Super Sunshield Bright Veil* and significantly lighter than Benefique's sunscreen.

There are several interesting plant extracts included within the formulation.  They are listed below, but I don't put much weigh on skincare benefits from sunscreens, besides the obvious sun protection.

- *S. stolonifera* supposedly possesses anti-cancer properties (2).

- *S. angustifolia* has been reported to inhibit melanogenesis (3).

- *S. jambos* seems to have anti-oxidative properties (4).

This sunscreen contains fragrance, and the fragrance is mild to moderate in strength.  To me, it smells of green florals, suspended in the salty, ozonic tang of marine breeze.  It smells exactly like the tropical beach resorts of my childhood, and I love it.  The scent dissipates after approximately half an hour of wear.

Overall, it's very nice, but all of these will not induce me to seriously consider making this my regular sunscreen, not at JPY 4,500 for each tiny bottle.  The cooling sensation that it gives, however, does push this sunscreen straight into ""favourite summer sunscreen so far"" status.

The menthol is slightly strong for the first couple of seconds after application, but it quickly mellows into a refreshing skin feel.  Every movement seems to send a soft, gentle breeze blowing across my skin.  I love putting this on my neck; it is the best repellent that I have so far against muggy Nagoya weather.  While my colleagues are wilting in the heat and humidity, I hold my chin up high, borne aloft by the cool breath of *HydroFresh*.

To me, this sunscreen is a prime example of how the ingredient list is not the be-all and end-all of a product; formulation plays a major part, too.  It's hard to predict what one's skin will like or dislike.  Apologies to all the neglected to-be-tested-TM sunscreens, but this summer, I think you will only be prying this sunscreen off my cold (and mentholated) dead hands.

---

(1) This one annoyed me slightly.  You might have known, but royal jelly is a break-out trigger for me, when it is present in a significant amount.  I purchased this sunscreen in a hurry (it was near the store's closing time), and I asked the sales assistant whether it contained ginseng (another trigger) and royal jelly or not.  To be fair, her exact wording was, ""I don't *think* so.""  Still, I got that cold dread dropping from my heart down to the pit of my stomach when I came home after a day of being slathered in this sunscreen, only to glance through the packaging's ingredient list and see royal jelly being listed.  The sunscreen has not broken me out yet, so I would assume that any royal jelly present is under my tolerance threshold.

izzvlogs,"[Review] Klavuu Red Pearlsation UV Protection City Defender SPF50+ PA+++ - I received this product in a box, free, from Charis. They were promoting themselves during the StyleCon Asia convention and sent everyone who signed up with them a free box of products.

ANYWAY. This product actually reminds me of the Biore UV Aqua Rich Water Essence in texture, colour and finish. It doesn't have a citrus-y scent though, and it doesn't have much of a scent really. It dries semi-matte, lightweight and doesn't really affect my make-up application. There's no white cast and I think the semi-matte comes from the pearl extract that is in it. It's not all that shimmery though.

I really enjoy this product and it hasn't broken me out (but that doesn't really matter as my acne is very very hormonal and it's kept at bay with BCP). Would re-purchase but it seems that it's double the price of the Biore on eBay :(",905,159,asian_beauty
that_girl_lauren,"[Review] Elsa Gusa Ceramide Moist Essence - Hello Asian Beauty Readers!


I have been asked a few times to write up my opinion of this product. Here it is:


*My skin type:* Normal, but suffering from hormonal breakouts since a teenager. I have PCOS, so my skin is quite temperamental in the U-zone, but otherwise not too bad. Tends toward oily in the t-zone and dry everywhere else, but not overly so.


*Looking for:* Post-Inflammation Hyperpigmentation relief, moisture, faster healing time between active use, no new breakouts.


*TL,DR:* good product, high price, want to try Striata as a replacement, then I'll do a Striata Liquid Gold vs. Elsa Gusa Ceramide Moist.


*First impressions:*

* Nice smooth texture, similar to Mizon All-In-One, but slightly thinner. 
* Packaging is cute and practical, the brow serum pump will be great to reuse! 
* 30ml is quite a small size
* Scent is ceramide-y. No fragrance. Yay!


*After 3 weeks use:*

* I'm going through this really quickly--Need 5 pumps to cover my face. Cost per use on this product sucks!
* My skin can tolerate more actives when I use this ever night between treatments (AHA facial), that's nice.
* The product goes on nicely and sinks into my skin better than Mizon All-In-One, like an essence should.


*Overall*: 6/10

Elsa Gusa has made a nice product with a good ingredient list, but it isn't a game-changer for me. If this was readily available and cost $12 per 30ml, I would probably repurchase. For $50 over eBay with 4 weeks ship time, I'm not going to repurchase. The most unique part of this product is that it provides the benefits of ceramides without the tacky, sticky feeling that Rosette gel leaves.


I guess if you had infinite money and very little tolerance for tacky-feeling facial products, this one would be for you!


I don't regret my purchase, but I also think I would use Rosette or some other ceramide product that has a better per-use value.


Next up: Hanyul Watery Calming Essence will replace this one in my routine (Thanks Jolse Random Box!).

antairi,"[Discussion] What product completely defied your expectations? (Good or bad)! - SO yesterday I was bored and plucking my fine moustache hairs with a tweezer and my skin got pretty irritated with me. I had a scrounge around my toiletries cabinet and found a small bottle of Argan oil that I received a while ago as a sample gift and forgotten about. Decided to try it out on my upper lip area to see if it could soothe it.  
  
I only spread about a drop and OH MY GOODNESS I was instantly shocked at how quickly it absorbed. It wasn't oily like when I tried coconut oil or jojoba oil on my face. Later that night when I washed my face I decided to try it out as a full face moisturiser. Admittedly, I think I put a bit too much, as my face was pretty oily and it hadn't fully adsorbed even an hour after I applied it. I wasn't expecting much, I half expected to just wake up with a face full of oil.  
  
But let me tell you I woke up this morning to pure velvet on my skin!!!! I still can't get over it. I've never had such a good reaction to a product before. There's no morning oiliness at all (which sometimes happens if I moisturise with a cream before bed). I'm just so excited guys.  
  
Anyway, that's enough of my rant (sorry!! :) ) - what products have completely surprised you and smashed your expectations the way argan oil did with me? Good or bad!

beauty_ghetto,"[Discussion] What's your favourite sunscreen for daily use? - Hi again, I'm here to start off another discussion. So what is your favourite sunscreen. Mine are:

The Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Face Sunscreen Sunscreen SPF 50 - a very sheer, tinted, all-mineral sunscreen that is great for oily, combination and normal skin types. Tint is there to primarily take away any white cast. Leaves a smooth, primer like finish that is great for makeup. I personally find that the tint works great for my skin type (NC10-12) and leaves no trace of a brownish/yellow cast. This sunscreen controls my sebum production really well and is water resistant for up to 80 minutes. This product was raved about on Angie's Hot and Flashy YouTube channel and only costs about anywhere between 13-14USD. I'm from Australia myself but find that Amazon is a decent way to obtain this if you're not from North America. And Ulta as well.

Please let me know what you like as a facial sunscreen?

proverbs3130,"[DISCUSSION] Does anyone else miss being tan? - I used to get to like an NC42-level tan (from my regular NC20-25). I looked at my feet the other day and I have a beautiful golden sandal tan, and a little part of me missed having that all over my body. But now that I'm so into AB and sun protection, I know I can't have that unless it's artificial. Plus it's kind of a pity that we're all going for bright, translucent skin but adding color that's not naturally there counteracts this. Does anyone else feel this way too?",522,99,asian_beauty

NotSoMuchDoctorHouse,"[Review] Snails, Scinic, Sheet Masks (long) - **General Info and Skin Type** Mid-twenties, continental Europe. Dealing with hormonal acne (mostly CCs, sometimes cystic). My skin has calmed down a lot in the past three years, however, it‚Äôs sensitive and reacts almost immediately to anything it does not like. Always on the dryer side, my skin has been chronically dehydrated since I‚Äôve started using tretinoin about 6 months ago. I get oily if I don‚Äôt moisturize properly. Been using actives for a total of 3 years, gradually progressing in strength and type. 

**Goals** Evening out skin tone and texture, fading PIE/PIH, ridding myself of those last stubborn CCs. Have healthy looking skin with wrinkles in the right places as time goes on - smile lines are fine, frown lines are not ;-) 

**Patch testing method** I patch test for 48 hours for allergic reactions, then I use the product on half my face for two weeks before evaluating if I should move on to a full faced test for another week or two. If I like it, the product stays. If I don‚Äôt, it goes on other parts of my body. 

**General approach to skin care** Skin care for me is a ritual, I like taking my time. However, in the mornings, I get up so early that I tend to save my actives for my evening routine. I like products that feel luxurious, so texture, packaging and fragrance factor into my decision whether I want to keep a product or not. Bearing this in mind however - if something works, it works. I travel a lot, so I simplify my routine for days on the road and break it down to the basics plus maybe one product that I take along solely for the pleasure of application. 

For ratings, I am using a scale aligned with [Fiddy‚Äôs](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com): 
1/5 - This should be taken off the market.
2/5 - This product was actively bad for my skin but might work for someone else. 
3/5 - Meh. Doesn‚Äôt hurt, doesn‚Äôt do anything special. 
4/5 - Quite good, I am liking this product.
5/5 - I never want to replace this.

RP - Will repurchase. 
WNR - Will not repurchase. 
HG - Holy Grail. 

**Benton Snail Bee Essence** This comes as a clear watery gel in a pump bottle. Easy to dispense and feels nice and cooling upon application. The smell is‚Ä¶well, weird - for me, it smells like dirt. However, it does not linger and while I enjoy nice fragrances, I am fine with my skincare not smelling perfectly pleasant. As this seems to be a favorite of this sub, I was a little disappointed that it didn‚Äôt do anything for me. It felt like it never quite sunk into my skin and rather formed a watery layer that was being pushed around. This could not be resolved by using less. I did not notice any effect, neither moisturizing nor healing nor soothing. My skin did not miss it when I left it out of my routine. In the end, I repurposed it as a cooling gel for my legs in summertime: I stuck it in the fridge and just massaged my calves with it after long runs. *(3/5 - WNR)*

**Mizon Snail Recovery Gel** This is a fairly odorless gel that comes in a tube. I‚Äôll cut to the chase, I did not like this. It was sticky, no matter how little I applied, I never felt comfortable wearing it and after one particular instant where I applied this to my face next to an open window out in the country and five minutes later, my face was yellow with pollen sticking to it, I just said goodbye. Used this up as a body moisturizer, didn‚Äôt hurt, didn‚Äôt do much. *(3/5 - WNR)*

**cosrx Snail 96 Mucin Essence** Snail does not seem to do anything for me. After ditching the Benton Snail Bee Essence, I switched to this. Again, this is a clear gel dispensed in a pump bottle. It goes on well, sinks in fairly quickly and has a neutral fragrance. However, I did not notice any benefit from it and again, my skin did not miss the snail when I dropped it out of my routine. Currently using it after shaving my legs, it seems to help with razor burn. *(3/5 - WNR)*

**Scinic Honey All-in-one Ampoule** This is a very runny gel-like ampoule in a very impractical container. The tub is huge and in this sub, you‚Äôll mostly hear that users have decanted it into another container for easier and more hygienic access. Same goes for me, I dispensed it from a pump bottle. It looks like honey, it smells almost like honey, a little goes a very long way and it‚Äôs full of good stuff. I can completely understand why it is so beloved, although I personally did not become a huge fan. It was decent and gave me a little boost of hydration, but I always felt it was sticky, even when using the most minuscule amounts or adding a mist afterwards. I wanted to love it so much but finally decided to part with it as part of my facial routine. I am currently using it as a moisturizing layer on my arms and hands after coming out of the shower. Weirdly enough, it‚Äôs not as sticky on my body, so I bask in the smell of sweet honey and enjoy it as part of my body care routine. *(Face: 3/5 - WNR; Body: 4/5 - RP)*

**My Beauty Diary Black Pearl Sheet Mask** Oh the plumpness! I love everything about this sheet mask. The fragrance is faint but pleasant, the mask is easy to unfold due to the plastic sheet stuck to it, simple to apply and the fit is fine. After leaving this on for 20 minutes, I notice a visible difference in hydration and firmness of skin, I feel plump and moisturized. This sheet mask was my savior when beginning to use tretinoin and I now enjoy it as a special treatment once a week. It is literally dripping with essence. The only reason I‚Äôm not rating it as a holy grail is that I‚Äôm stubborn and I want to have a reason to continue to try sheet masks in search of it. *(4.8/5 - RP so much)*

**My Beauty Diary Apple Polyphenol Sheet Mask** Similar to the Black Pearl, although not quite as moisturizing. I love these fresh out of the refrigerator in summertime. Bonus: This smells like apple cider. Yum. *(4/5 - RP)*

**Tosowoong Pure Propolis Sheet Mask** This is a decent sheet mask. The fit is good, it‚Äôs saturated with essence, it doesn‚Äôt smell like anything to me. The effect it has on my skin is no miracle, but I notice a good boost in hydration. The price point is fine as well. *(3.8/5 - RP)*

MolangNeoi,"[DISCUSSION] Anti-Aging - Okay so in following a lot of western AND asian skincare, I've noticed something. Western skincare always seems to be gearing their skincare towards 'anti-aging', especially in high end skincare (I went to Nordstrom in the Eaton Centre for fun and l could not GET AWAY from the word anti aging). I mainly follow asian skincare through this subreddit and western AB blogs, but I've never noticed anti aging even being brought up. Here it seems that the focus is more on complexion and getting a nice healthy radiance from the skin. Obviously there is the Missha Time Rewind series, but other than that it's not really mentioned here. Why not?

So I wanted to know if Kose makes a vitamin c essence or serum, and if they do, what percentage it is. Does anyone know? I know very little about japanese skincare brands so I actually don't even know where Kose falls in the spectrum of brands (road shop? Mid to high end?). I'd love to hear about other people's experiences with these masks or this brand.

RealArc,"Haul and one cleansing balm review (Japan trip in February) [Review] - Hello,

I recently vacationed in Japan and picked up some stuff. Lots of Korean products since I checked out Shin-Okubo and the sales lady was... very persuading, haha.

I did pick some stuff which I haven't seen here (correct me if I'm wrong) and I will slowly post reviews once I use them.

My haul:
http://imgur.com/vUwSmtq

I forgot to photograph other stuff I'd already bought and used like DHC lipbalm, Kiss me Heroine mascara, Kate eyeshadow, Canake eyeshadow primer, super cute headband from Tokyu Hands (purple and mint)...

First of all, a cleansing balm. I normally use **Shu Uemura ultime8 sublime beauty cleansing oil** (+ either Hada Labo cleanser or a cheapo German one as 2nd cleanser) and I looove it. It even gets rid of the Kiss me Heroine mascara!

I was browsing in a Ainz&amp;Tulpe shop in Harajuku and saw this and thought it sounded interesting:

* Cationic surfacant free (I'd to google this)
* Fragrance free
* Colorant free
* Paraben free
* Alcohol free
* Mineral oil free

And it was pretty cheap 1620 yen for 100 g. It comes with a little plastic spoon (hidden under the lid).

This is how it looks undisturbed:

http://imgur.com/l8bdfJ2

On the spoon:

On skin (slightly massaged in):

I put on the following:

http://imgur.com/1KTo3LU

* Liquid foundation (Chifure)
* One-day tattoo super black eyeliner (only thing my oily eyelids will not destroy)
* Guerlain red lipstick
* Shu Uemura purple eyeshadow

You have to use it on dry skin, take a small amount of the balm  and massage it onto the skin. Then rinse with warm water.

Before rinsing:

(You can see it took off my foundation, lipstick and eyeshadow but the eyeliner remains)

After rinsing:

(Yay, eyeliner is gone!)

My skin hasn't freaked out yet (it felt soooft). Their lotion apparently is pretty popular but since it is a new product I haven't found any reviews on it.

atommom,"[HAUL][REVIEW]February Facetory Box - Hi! I've been lurking here for a little over a month, and have so far loved all the AB products added to my routine. Props and many thanks to you all!

I knew I wanted to add sheet masks to my routine, but was feeling a little overwhelmed with all the choices. I first learned about Facetory after a few clicks through my AB search results. A couple of you have tried this subscription box and seemed pleased with the contents and value so I figured I'd just go for it. Well, it came today! I excite! I have never used any of these masks, so I'd love to hear some feedback if you have experience with them. 

**Otherwise, here's a short unboxing review with [pics](http://imgur.com/a/sF38C)**


I went straight for the 7 count version because I had a coupon code for 20%off (freshtolux). This box is normally $14.95 (w/free shipping), and they offer a 4-count option for $4.95 ($.99 shipping). Shipping outside the US is atrocious. Sorry u_u

Here's what came in the box!

* **JayJun Rose Blossom Mask**

* **Beltune Dalkorom Aroma Geranium Mask**

* **White Jade Aid Magic Glutathione Mask**

* **No:hj Opuntia Humifusa Mask**

* **Mediheal Line Friends IPI Lightmax Ampoule Mask**

* **Vescillonia Enrich Facial Mask Calendula**

* **DearPacker Black Tea and Black Rose Hydrogel Mask**




Now, I just have to figure out which to use first!

I'm not affiliated with Facetory in any way.

panda_98,"[Fluff] Asian Beauty is giving me confidence - I have oily, acne prone skin (may or may not be hormonal) with dark circles under my eyes, blackheads on my nose, and some acne scarring. My skin would be reasonably okay until PMS, which is when my face would break out. My face always looked and felt like I was frying bacon on it 24/7, making it to where I refused to have my picture taken because of how much I hated my face. If I looked at myself in the mirror, I hated my face even more. Nothing worked for me (Proactiv, St. Ives, Biore), so after months of product research, I caved and started an Asian Beauty Routine at around Christmas time.

So far, my routine looks like this (I have more products coming in*):

AM:
- Skinfood Green Tea Foaming Cleanser

- OST C20 Vitamin C Serum (just came in today)

- Etude House Moistfull Collagen Emulsion (after 30 minute wait time)

- Mizon Snail Repair Eye Cream (came in today)

- MISSHA All Around Safe Block Waterproof Sun Milk SPF 50

PM:
- The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil

- Skinfood Green Tea Cleansing Foam

- COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid (wait 30 minutes after applying)

- COSRX AHA Whitehead Power Liquid (came in today, also wait 30 minutes after application)

- Sheetmask (once a week)

- Mizon Snail Repair Eye Cream

- Etude House Moistful Collagen Emulsion

It's been a couple of weeks, and while I still have some acne scarring and breakouts, I can tell that they're starting to get better. My pimples are starting to clear up some, and my face feels so soft, smooth, and not like the bottom of a grease filled frying pan (even though the blackheads are still there). I can finally leave the house with some confidence in myself, and I can't wait to see how much progress I'll make months from now! Any advice and constructive criticism for my routine is welcome!

brnbrnbrn2017,"Review, Take Two: Koh Gen Do Maifanshi Moisture Foundation - After I tested the Aqua Foundation and found out that it didn't live up to my lofty expectations/memories, I had some trepidation about testing KGD's Maifanshi Moisture Foundation which is one of my Holy Grails. I hadn't been using it in a while and I wanted to see if it was as good as I remembered. 

Since I was feeling kind of dry, I picked up some Bobbi Brown Tinted Moisturizing Balm because I wanted a really moisturizing primer/skincare product I could wear alone or without makeup. Priming my skin with a pea-sized amount of that, I used my trusty ellana Stay Gorgeous brush to apply the foundation and to buff it out as needed. I also used a pinpoint concealing brush and a Hakuhodo Blending brush for my concealer (MAC Prolongwear mixed with ettusais BB cream). Then I set the whole thing with a very light layer of KGD's loose powder.  

Here are the tools, my face without makeup and with makeup. Will post check-ins at the 4 hour mark and the 8 hour mark: http://imgur.com/a/dpP8z

These are EXTREME closeups of my pores and skin because my primary concern here really is wear time and texture. 

ETA:

I realized belatedly that I didn't add Hydrabio serum to the foundation to sheer it out so I redid the whole thing. This step is important because if you don't add some type of silicone based product to this foundation, it will settle into your pores. You could do with their primers which are supposedly very good but I'm happy with the Bioderma Hydrabio serum. 

4 hours in, daylight: http://imgur.com/a/5GjJs

Overall it's still holding up quite well. No settling into pores or clinging to dry patches. Will see how it wears throughout the day. 

TL;DR: Here's my face the full 8 hours in: http://imgur.com/a/Mtl5k
Please excuse the weird reddish tone on my face and neck in this photo. Dunno what happened there but that's not the foundation's fault. Maybe it was just the shadows because I was facing a window. 

In summary, the texture and the wear was good throughout the day. Didn't settle into my pores when mixed in with a serum/primer, didn't emphasise dryness or texture on my face, didn't make me look older. Thankfully, this one is still very much an HG.",2247,393,asian_beauty

**[Rire Lip Powders Review + Swatches](https://fishscalekisses.wordpress.com/2016/11/25/rire-lip-powder-swatches-review/)** TL;DR: These lip powders were given to me by BB Cosmetic in exchange for my honest review. Not my favorite lip product. They weren't drying or moisturizing and they didn't stain or tint my lips. Do not breathe in or risk unpleasant tastes and coughing. 


**[Noto Cream vs Mirakle Cream: Review and Thoughts](https://fishscalekisses.wordpress.com/2016/11/26/noto-cream-vs-better-skin-mirakle-cream-review-and-thoughts/)** TL;DR: I was given the Noto Cream to review but purchased the Mirakle Cream with help from 0.8Liter coupon. Not very good for facial moisturizing. Great for really dry, rough hands. And other body parts, perhaps. 


**[What Is Next Beauty Kit November 2016 Un-bagging](https://fishscalekisses.wordpress.com/2016/11/26/w-i-n-beauty-kit-november-2016-un-bagging/)** TL;DR: I bought this. Great bag. Am looking forward to next month.

snowsilk,"Applying BB Cushions correctly? - I have the (old) Laneige BB cushion (pore cushion) and can't figure out why it's not working for me 

While the coverage is great and it's easy to blend, it feels very uncomfortable. It feels like it's sitting on my skin instead of sinking in. I definitely constantly feel like I have something on. Even though it's supposed to be for oily skin, the situation gets worse as the day progresses. It's almost like as sebum is produced, the foundation ends up floating on top. 

I'm trying to figure out if I'm just using this wrong, or if this product isn't suitable for me. 

I usually apply this after my full skincare routine. I think my skin is relatively decent: not too dry, and only oily around my t zone. I press it into my skin in a rolling motion. I then set it with the Innisfree no sebum powder which helps take away that tacky greasy feeling. 

A few questions: 

1) am I doing this wrong? E.g. should I be applying a primer before this?

2) or is this simply the wrong product for me? I just need light/medium coverage to cover the redness around my nose and chin. If this is the wrong product, what else would you recommend?

**WNR:** Will not repurchase
**MR:** Might repurchase
**WR:** Will repurchase

**Missha Eye Fit Stick Shadow: French Roasting &amp; Maple Honey** [Swatches](http://imgur.com/m8UnGe7)

French Roasting:

A matte dark brown with a warm red undertone. Goes on easily and smoothly and feels creamy. This will crease without primer. Longevity is‚Ä¶ okay it‚Äôs a bit shit. I mean I‚Äôm not great at eyeshadow, hence why I bought the sticks, but it‚Äôs pretty bad. I don‚Äôt have particularly oily lids and I did try this with primer but in under 30 mins the gorgeous rich dark brown turns into a flat greyish brown. I mean I even tried it with a powder shadow on top but still no luck. It‚Äôs rather unfortunate because the initial pigmentation is gorgeous. **WNR**

Maple Honey:

A warm honey brown, can easily be darkened with a couple of layers. While it is described as matte it does have a few flecks of shimmer in it, which does give it a bit of subtle creamy glossiness but if you‚Äôre after a proper matte, this isn‚Äôt it. Like French Roasting it goes on smoothly with a creamy feel and will crease without primer. The longevity is substantially better, probably due to the lighter tone, but it still fades faster than some of my powder shadows. **MR**

**Clio Kill Black Waterproof Pen Liner**

Excellent, highly pigmented black that comes out easily. The pen tip is stiff but not like you‚Äôre at risk of stabbing your eye. It does not smudge at all on me and I have previously used Bobbi Brown gel liner, Maybelline master precise and gel liner and a number of drugstore pencil liners, all of which smudged to some degree. It lasts very well and when it begins to wear off it doesn‚Äôt smudge, it just cracks a little, however I‚Äôve not noticed any flakes appearing under my eyes so it may just fade with some cracking but not flaking. **WR**


**A‚ÄôPIEU Harutatoo Brown: #1 Dark Brown** [Swatches](http://imgur.com/HZlNTjU)

I wanted to try a marker-style brow product (but not one of the week-long tints since I was worried about how they might fade). I couldn‚Äôt find too many reviews on this but, compared to Clio, skinfood, espoir and 3ce‚Ä¶ it was cheap. And I am cheap and stingy. Honestly, I have no regrets; this is fantastic. The longevity is great, the pigmentation is buildable and strong and it‚Äôs a great match for natural dark black hair without looking like you‚Äôve sharpied your brows on. It is blendable, if you tap or rub it while it‚Äôs still a little wet you can sheer out the colour so you can make the front ends look natural. If you go too heavy then brushing it with a spoolie can fade it quite effectively so that‚Äôs also good to make the front look natural. One of the few actual pictures I managed to find of this product showed the tip looking like a 3 year old had thought it was a pen and smashed it into a page; thankfully it‚Äôs not. The tip is nicely pointed, allowing you to do the tail of the brow easily. It isn‚Äôt thin enough to draw individual hairs, but I feel like the consistency and colour of the product are more suited to outlining and colouring in the brow, rather than lightly drawing in individual hairs. Compared to a number of other brow markers it has considerable more product in it. And it‚Äôs stupidly cheap. Like dude, it‚Äôs about 1USD/g if you buy at Jolse in a sale. BBIA is 2.5USD/g, Skinfood is 1.5USD/g, 3CE is 5USD/g, espoir is freaking 20USD/g. I mean I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve all got varying formulas but A‚ÄôPIEU is damn good and damn cheap! **WR**


**Etude House Dr. Mascara Fixer**

Like nature abhors a vacuum, my lashes abhor a curl.  Prior to this, I had been using the water resistant Covergirl Lashblast fusion which looked nice but I had to recurl after applying it and it smudged at little. This holds a curl nicely, not stellar but decent and I generally don‚Äôt have to recurl. It also does a great job of preventing smudging if I apply a coat of a non-waterproof mascara over it. When used on its own, it does have a lengthening effect because of the fibres but because the liquid is clear, it can look a bit odd. It won‚Äôt look white, but it‚Äôll just be semi-clear and subtly make your lashes look a little odd at the ends. That said, it‚Äôs not too noticeable and performs well overall. **MR**


**Heroine Make Volume &amp; Curl Mascara Advanced Film** [Swatch? B&amp;A?](http://imgur.com/onOfga2)

Despite having heard so many raves regarding the classic kiss me heroine make mascaras I was rather reluctant to try them because of how hard they were to remove and how stiff they made your eyelashes. This mascara has neither of these issues. It holds a curl excellently, I don‚Äôt even need to recurl after applying, and it doesn‚Äôt smudge one bit. My lashes don‚Äôt feel stiff, they have a good amount of flex to them.
The fibres are not nearly as long nor prone to looking odd as the Etude House Dr Fixer. Mascara but they still contribute to length. There is very minimal clumping and multiple layers can be added without looking like you have only 3 eye lashes.
Warm water is effective to get it off your lashes but it may cause some smudging underneath the eyes that is a bit trickier to remove. However, since I generally wear this with eyeliner and shadow that don‚Äôt come off in just warm water, generally I end up oil cleansing it off. And when that happens‚Ä¶ I look like [Furiosa](http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files/styles/tout_image_612x380/public/i/2014/06/24/Imperator-Furiosa_612x380.jpg?itok=JHZQLlIJ) (but with none of Charlize Theron‚Äôs other stunning features, dammit.) **WR forever and ever**


**A‚ÄôPIEU Moist Creamy Concealer: #2 Vanilla** [Swatches](http://imgur.com/ukp6o22)

Okay after hearing many raves about this product I wanted to give it a shot for use as an under eye concealer. I‚Äôve previously used MAC pro longwear, Maybelline fit me, and a garnier roll on concealer, all of which looked somewhat cakey and accentuated all the little bumps I have under my eyes. In comparison, this is brilliant. The texture isn‚Äôt drying, it‚Äôs lovely and creamy. Its longevity is good and it doesn‚Äôt seem to crease easily or extensively. The shade is rather pink, and personally it‚Äôs a bit light for me but that works okay in the under eye region. As a regular concealer it‚Äôs not as good, the coverage isn‚Äôt as great, perhaps because the creamy texture smudges it out. Regardless, it‚Äôs still a decent multipurpose concealer but it is a stellar under eye concealer. **WR**

**Innisfree Water Fit Cushion: #23**

Okay this is my second cushion after IOPE C23 (a bit too dark and it felt somewhat tacky in finish) and I adore it. The coverage is not high but it does a good job of reducing the uneven appearance of skin and slight redness. The longevity is good, it‚Äôs not drying but with my dry/normal skin I occasionally start noticing a few dry patches after several hours, nothing major though. It has a lovely finish, somewhat dewy but certainly not bordering on oily (at least not for my dry skin). I‚Äôve not noticed much transfer and it doesn‚Äôt feel heavy or sticky on the face. It wears really nicely and it‚Äôs a very good match for my skin which is excellent! (for comparison, I also wear Bobbi Brown Skin foundation in 2.5 (a smidge to dark for my post-winter and study face) and my MAC prolongwear concealer in NC20 is a little too dark for me now.  
Also while the eco fitting puff is the tiniest bit smaller than the standard rubycell puffs,**they both fit comfortably in the case**. So if you bulk buy those rubycell puffs they will still fit. Also due to the texture on the fitting puff it can sometimes leave light imprints on your skin so be sure to blend. **WR**


**The Saem Saemmul Perfect Pore Cover**

Very finely milled white power that on light skin doesn‚Äôt change skin tone but likely will with darker skin tones. While Rimmel stay matte and Australis Banana Powder both looked slightly cakey on me, particularly in the under eye region, this absolutely does not. It gives a smooth matte finish without caking up. I don‚Äôt have particularly oily skin however in Australian 30degree+ days with stupidly high humidity, it does pretty well at keeping the shine at bay. FYI, does not taste good, would not recommend, 0/10. **WR**",8265,1435,asian_beauty

SummerNight888,"What motivates you to keep looking after your skin the way you do? - Results? (meaning noticeable improvements such as healthier-looking skin, reduction of acne, firmer skin, etc) Maybe you do it because it is in your opinion a valid option for contrasting ageing? Or because it just relaxes you? Or is skincare ingrained in your mentality as a ""necessary"" practice to follow so it's natural for you to just look after your skin? (I say this because it totally isn't the case for me. I thought skincare beyond the basic washing and moisturizing with a cream was unnecessary and a waste of money).

For me, I keep doing it firstly because I indeed saw results by taking care of my skin the way I do (that is, with a much more complex routine made of different products and different practices in general). I would never ever keep spending time and money on skincare if I hadn't seen satisfying results. I luckily didn't have a horrible skin to start with, but I used to suffer with quite constant breakouts, a **bad** texture (sooo many CCs) and general dull-looking skin and a weird skin type (combo at its purest form: oily on the T-area and dry on the rest).

Building a proper skincare routine along with better practices (thinking of you, double cleansing &lt;3 and sunscreen!) gave me a much much healthier-looking skin that is just plumper, brighter, more glowing and ""juicier"". So much smoother too (thanks, acids!). Skin type changed and it's much easier to deal with (it's mostly normal and tends to combination if the weather is hot). But especially, it reduced the occurences of breakouts A LOT. A real lot. Now I only get spots like once every 2 months? Roughly. And I do get surprised when I do (like: ""Oh, a zit? that's weird."", whereas before I was like: ""here we go, another zit. Boooring."")

Secondly, nobody will ever give me the confirmation that anti-aging products do 100% work, but it is well known that just keeping your skin hydrated is plain good for it. So yeah, I do it, it surely doesn't hurt, and if they'll really help me contrast/minimize ageing then well, that's a nice plus!

ParanSkies,"[B&amp;A] AHA and BHA is not the end game. Don't be afraid to try prescription medication! (X-Post from r/SkincareAddiction) - http://imgur.com/a/RIoFs

[LONG POST, SORRY!]

Hello everyone!

I decided to write a progress report, for my own sake as well as to encourage others to try out tretinoin as well. My skin has never been very bad growing up. I guess the only problems I had were redness around my nose and an uneven skin tone. The only products I ever used was hydrating toner and lotion. I thought my skin wasn't very nice at the time... I laugh at how ungrateful I was then.

Fast forward to when I turned 19. My skin was starting to become more acne-prone. I quickly nipped that bud by starting COSRX AHA and BHA after discovering r/AsianBeauty. My skin was AMAZING for those few months. I started using more products such as essences and serums. OST's Vitamin C serum was super important because although I occasionally got acne, it always left a mark that took forever to go away.

Jump to when I turned 20. For some reason, chemical exfoliants weren't working anymore. I started getting more and more acne and it wouldn't go away. I was getting kinda depressed, so I asked a family doctor to give me tretinoin, after reading about it a bit on r/SkincareAddiction. He brushed me off saying it wasn't a first line of treatment, and Biacna (or Ziana in the US) is all I probably need. He gave me a few samples to try. Well I had no idea how to use Biacna since it's not a super popular treatment, and I stuffed the samples in my drawer for a year. I continued to try using BHA and AHA, eventually sticking only to Stridex since that seemed to help a TINY bit. COSRX's BHA seemed to do nothing for my skin, and I suspected their AHA was making my breakouts even worse. A-sol was useless as well. I tried chemical peels from MUAC, which helped the skin that didn't have acne, but only caused me to purge in my problem areas without making it better than pre-peel.

My skin was only getting worse and worse, so I took out my Biacna samples (they had another year before expiry). I realized that it was EXACTLY THE SAME AS RETIN-A, except it has clindamycin in it as well and is %&amp;ing expensive. The next morning, my skin was unbelievably smooth where I had no acne. I knew it would take longer for it to help with my acne, and there would probably be an awful purge. I quickly went to see my doctor at university (she's MUCH nicer and knowledgable) who gave me a prescription for generic tretinoin gel 0.025%. The pharmacy gave me Retin-A gel for some reason, but for the generic price?? Not that I'm complaining.

**WEEK 1** - Moderate purging, nothing makeup can't cover.

**WEEK 2** - Purging has mostly subsided. Light flaking around my mouth area and where my largest zits were.

**CURRENT/WEEK 3** - I think my moisture barrier got damaged. I never had sensitive skin, but everything I put on my face hurt, especially my HG Cerave PM :( Took a day break from Retin-A and went out to get La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Fluide (received a deluxe Toleriane Cleanser sample as well) which was sooo nice for my face. I buffered with a toner the day after the break prior to Retin-A, and I think I will do that from now on since it barely stung.


Right now, I'm very upset with the original doctor I went to see who brushed off my request for tretinoin. I could have avoided a year of frustration and low self-esteem, as well as comments from family members who told me my skincare was useless since it did nothing for my acne. However, I'm grateful that I finally managed to hop onto the tretinoin wagon. I'm eagerly waiting for the day where my PIH will clear up and I can go out with just a tinted moisturizer.


**TL;DR** - *If BHA/AHA works for you, then wonderful! However, I ended up realizing that sometimes, Asian skincare is not the be all end all of my acne woes. Don't be afraid to incorporate prescription strength medication into your routine, even if it might go against the ""natural"" philosophy of many Asian products.",4047,733,asian_beauty

Namely, the glue in two brushes has come loose. I don't know if it's because I wash them after every use but I also notice oily white goo coming from the area where the hairs are glued with some of the brushes.

So - can oil cleanser dissolve some glues? Has anyone else experienced something like this? Are my brushes just past their prime?

shereeny,"Banila Co. Clean It Zero ‚Äì&gt; breakouts? - I've seen a fair number of people claim that Banila Co. Clean It Zero caused them breakouts, while it seems to be a HG product for many others.

I usually don't see specifics mentioned, so I was wondering ‚Äì for the people who noticed breakouts, were you using it as the first step in double-cleansing, or alone as your only cleanser?

Presumably it's a balm meant for double-cleansing and I don't see why it would cause breakouts if it's washed off immediately anyway, but I wanted to be sure before I bother disturbing my currently calm skin. I got the regular version for free thanks to a gift card, but I could still return it. 

P.S. On the other hand, to people who have used Clean It Zero successfully: if your skin was already fine (especially without double-cleansing), did you find that the cleanser took your skin to new amazing levels deserving of HG status? Is there another oil-based cleanser that did? Or is there really no need to take this extra step, particularly if you rarely wear makeup?

blacktieaffair,"AB Nancy Drews, I need your help figuring out the HG ingredients from the Leaders' AC Dressing Mask for daily use. - So... I have pretty persistent rosacea/facial redness. My face can be like 4-5 shades darker/redder than my neck. I have tons of errythmea in like every part of my face too. Most of the time, I look super sunburnt, even with regular sunscreen/AHA/essence use.

I already use niacinamide (Deciem 10% Niacinamide, plus the niacinamide in the Elta MD UV Clear sunscreen) as well as some brightening products (CosRX Galactomyces Essence, Benton Snail Bee Essence). None of them seem to really do anything for redness at all.

The ONLY 2 products that have ever made a difference are Mizon Snail Recovery Gel (which, of course, breaks me out so I can't use it) and the Leaders Insolution AC Dressing Mask.

But holy hell, *nothing* works like Leaders. I have no idea what it does to my face. Yesterday, I was having a particularly bad bout of redness. I applied the mask and woke up with a significantly lighter skin tone, like almost matching my skin. And it has done this consistently every single time I've used it. And nothing about it breaks me out. It's by far the best mask I have ever used, and is pretty much permanent HG status for me. Unfortunately, since it's just a mask, the nice effects wear off in about a day.

So, what could be the secret HG foundation lurking in this mask? I want to find ingredients similar to this in an essence/ampoule for daily use. The ingredients list from CosDNA is below. 

I guess the first inclination would be the snail secretion filtrate, but then why wouldn't the Benton essence carry the same relief? I've also used the Benton Snail Bee Cream and the CoxRX 96 Snail Mucin Essence, both of which broke me out and didn't really seem to provide redness relief.

waitwuh,"I'm heartbroken - Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream seems to have changed their formula - I just picked up my package - a much-anticipated restock of my daily bb cream which I ordered from Missha's US website - only to discover the ingredients have been altered from my last haul. A lot of the good stuff that I loved for the skin benefits has been moved down the list considerably. I've always loved this bb cream because the #13 shade fits my skin pretty perfectly, and I'm generally demanding of my makeup in that I want it to be making me look better in the long run as well as the short run. Missha's ingredient list seemed to have some pretty great additions to do just that; It had a decent Pa protection rating and some ingredients I valued such as arbutin, squalane, adenosine, and ceramide.  Now... I think I might start looking for a new daily bb cream. Something with a similar shade, equal or better sun protection, but more potent anti-aging and completion-improving ingredients. If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them! 

For the curious - I've included the ingredient lists for comparison. While the old list can be found on various old reviews (such as one I grabbed from [here](http://nouveaucheap.blogspot.com/2012/09/review-missha-perfect-cover-bb-cream.html), the latest rendition on [missha's site](http://www.misshaus.com/m-perfect-cover-bb-cream-spf-42-pa.html) has some considerable changes, at least IMHO. Maybe it's less a big deal to others, idk.

ilovetoner,"Actives: How they changed your routines? - From our 1st bottle of CosRX BHA, to our 3rd tube of 0.1% tretinoin, most actives force us to reconsider the products we use and the position that they are applied on, as to leave a semblance of a moisture barrier/skin for the next day and beyond. 

So r/AsianBeauty, how have the actives you've introduced into your routine affected your routine, and the products you seek when buying? Did the burn of an AHA leave you running to a soothing sheetmask? Did a particularly strong percentage of tret have you smearing your face with humectants and ceramides? 

Here are the categories (feel free to add more if I've missed a few!):

- **AHA** (glycolic, lactic, mandelic etc.)
- **BHA** (salicylic, betaine salicylate etc.)
- **PHA** (azaleic, gluconolactone, etc.)
- **Retinoids** (retinoic acid, retinol, etc.)
- **Vitamin C** (ascorbic, SAP, MAP, etc.)

In your response, try outlining the product with the active, the effects it had on your skin, and what types of products/specific reccomendations for products you used to remedy these effects. It'll be awesome to see all the ways an AB routine can be used to mitigate the side effects of actives, so comment away :D",1213,204,asian_beauty

randystyle21,"2016 F/W New Korena Cosmetics - Disclaimer: I‚Äôm related to the business for Besfren Beauty and Masksheets.com. But in the contents below, I didn‚Äôt put any products that are sold under the business or plan to be sold in the near future. The purpose of this writing is purely for information sharing and fun. If any of the contents below are problematic, please let me know. 

There‚Äôs a sort of fixed trend for launching new cosmetics in Korean brands. From April to May, they bring sun-related products such as sunscreens, sun cushions or sun sticks. In summer, of course, light textured pore clearing products or brightening products are popular because of highly humid Korean summer. When the weather gets dry like now, deep hydration lines are on their best time. Korean winter is notoriously dry and many Koreans buy their F/W skincare routine around this time, so it is very important time for Korean brands as well. 
 3~4 years ago, oil based, fast absorbing, rich textured products were very popular, especially ceramide (Dr. Jart‚Äôs Ceramidine / Holika Holika‚Äôs Good Cera), omega-3 (IOPE‚Äôs Super Vita) and argan oil (many brands) contained products. Snail filtrate is all time favorite for all people so I won‚Äôt mention it much. Of course, facial oils are always ‚ÄúMust Launching‚Äù items.
But this year, the trend seems a little different from previous year. So I prepare some update for 2016 F/W Korean cosmetics, mostly from the road shop brands. 


1.Innisfree, the controversial Ture Care Cica Balm / New skincare line, The Black Green Tea 

So, Innisfree also launched this year‚Äôs hot ingredient -Centella Asiatica-based balm in early September. They actually did very brilliant marketing this year. They give away 5 day trial sample of this balm, promising improvement on acne scars (at least in the promotion video, it seems like working and I was quite satisfied with the 5 days trial as well). The early batches were sold out fast but interestingly the reviews are quite polarized. While many reviews, people stated actual and visible improvement on acne scars, but at the same time some of the reviews were complaining about break-outs and redness. Seemingly, these break-out or sensitivity comes from added retinols or stearic acid. (They are commonly used ingredients but sometimes it may induce sensitive on skin)  So if you plan to buy this, please do the patch test before you use. Innisfree offers ‚ÄúResponsible Refund Policy (Ï±ÖÏûÑÌôòÎ∂àÏ†ú),‚Äù so they give 7ml trial sample for free. It will be a little difficult for us to benefit from this policy though. Fermented Black Green Tea line is newly introduced as well. There are 3 types of products - serum, cream and wash off mask. In the website, it is stated that cream contains shea butter and serum contains platn squalene (From veggie oil) for oil so I think it will be a good hydration line for winter, if you like Innisfree. 

 

2. Etude House, Glow on Oil Volume Base

Since Etude House is heavily makeup focused brand, they didn‚Äôt introduce any new skincare line this F/W. If they do, I will update you later. The Facial Blur was a quite a thing this year. This shimmering primer quickly became the queen of glowing primer along with VDL‚Äôs Lumilayer. Certainly, they are inspired by Mac‚Äôs long time steady seller, the Strobe Cream. The difference is, they give much more natural look on face since Strobe Cream. Anyway, Etude House introduced another glowing primer this winter. The texture is not very mineral/shimmering like Blur, rather it provides oil/watery glow on your face. Texture is in between watery serum and facial oil, and contains golden shimmering particles in them. It feels much lighter than Nymph Glow or Blur, so I think this will be quite popular soon. They introduced lighter version of this base (Glow on Hydra Volume Base) as well. 


3. The Face Shop ‚Äì Korean Traditional Medicine Inspired

ÏòàÌôîÎã¥ Ï±ÑÏú® ÏÉùÍ∏∞ ÏàúÌôò ÏóêÏÑºÏä§ (CHAEYUL Revitalizing Essence) was introduced this F/W. This serum is made from LG‚Äôs high-end brand ‚ÄúThe History of Whoo‚Äù and formulated with lactobacillus / bean fermentation filtrate, plant squalene, shea butter and many other herb extracts, along with conventional ingredients. Interestingly, titanium dioxide is added for unknown reason (seemingly for the instant brightening). Since it claims to be Hanbang (Korean Traditional Medicine) cosmetic, it contains many herb extracts but compared to other brands, this serum doesn‚Äôt seem new. So in my humble / personal opinion, The Face Shop‚Äôs F/W was quite disappointing. (I‚Äôm not saying this product is bad or something, but I‚Äôm just saying it seems quite conventional compared to other brands) 



4. Tonymoly ‚Äì Black Tea London Classic Serum

So, probably, this F/W is a Tea Time. While Innisfree uses Green Tean, Tonlymoly brought Black Tea. They had collaboration with Taylors of Harrogate this year and they use black tea extract from England. They use black extract as a base, and added niacinamide as a brightening / anti-aging ingredient. They said Aureobasidium pullulans (black bacillus) filtrate was added but I couldn‚Äôt find them from their ingredient list, probably they are contained in their black tea extract base (56%). I think their composition approach is commendable since all of their ingredients are under EWG 2 level. It feels pretty nice and watery but sunflower seed oil and bergamot fruit oil nicely give hydration lock-up for skin. I was quite happy to see Tonymoly‚Äôs Black Tea London Classic Serum because I could see they tried really hard to make this serum with safer ingredients. Believe me, it is not easy to make a cosmetic without EWG 3,4,5 ingredients without compromising the texture. 



5. The Saem ‚Äì Urban Eco Waratah Cream 

Although Waratah didn‚Äôt come out this F/W, it is rather under-appreciated and it is a deep hydration line, so I will talk about this cream here. Just like the Saem did with many other products, the Saem substitute water with Waratah extract (55%) and used it as its base. As they market this cream as ‚Äúskin protection layer strengthening cream,‚Äù they added some skin identical, skin repairing molecules like ceramide NP and Phytosphingosine. I think one of the greatest strength in the products of the Seam is texture. This cream has fast-absorbing, silky, non-sticky texture. So if you are more like a texture person, this cream may be the one for this F/W. Ah, dimethicone is added for the texture, so be aware if it concerns you. But texture is just like heaven ÔÅä 

6.	It‚Äôs Skin, Flower Cell Cream 

After their famous snail cream, it‚Äôs skin‚Äôs skincare line has not been very successful for past few years. This year, It‚Äôs Skin brought Firming cream with Edelweiss Callus cell culture extract. I know callus cell culture‚Äôs skin improving ability is controversial and not scientifically proven most of the time, it is just nice to see It‚Äôs Skin‚Äôs new product. Other than Edelweiss callus cell culture extract, the composition is pretty conventional but they added good moisturizing ingredients like squalene, sodium hyaluronate and betaine. Adenosine is added as firming / anti-aging ingredient. As I mentioned above, I am really glad to see new skincare line from It‚Äôs Skin, but it‚Äôs quite questionable that this product will do really well in this competitive market this F/W because of their passive marketing and no ‚ÄúWow‚Äù or ‚ÄúNew‚Äù factor in this product.  Package design is also somewhat old as well.

:D Skincare I bought in the past few months... 

I'm nowhere near an expert like you guys so these are just some of my thoughts rather than a review!

As you guys can see I'm a huge fan of the Missha All-Around Safe Block Essence Sun and The Mizon Snail Recovery Gel. Not pictured is 2 of these I bought for my boyfriend (the sunscreen is actually his new favorite too so he carries a pink sunscreen around with him hehehe). The pink version of the Missha sunscreen is my favorite, it's light and putting it on feels like putting on a layer of moisturizer! The orange SPF50+ waterproof version feels thick and hard to spread. 

Did not like the Elizavecca Mily Piggy - irritated my face and I ended up all red after using it. It was also SUPER TICKLY when it was on my face. Read a lot of nice reviews on it so I guess YMMV and it's not for me :(. Not sure what to do with the other half of the bottle I have. 

I actually have 90% of the CosRX BHA and AHA left, I'm really tight on time and don't quite have time for actives... **I saw on the bottom of the Mizon AHA that it was made in 2014, does anyone know the shelf life? Should I toss it out?** 

*Did not like using BB cream, if anyone wants the Tony Moly Goddess Aura one in NYC and can take it from me in Flushing let me know :)! Let me know if this is against the rules I can edit this sentence out.*

Just bought the Benton Snail Bee Essence and the Mizon Good Night White, excited to try them!!

The Mizon King to the Kong (hehe) Aqua Step-Up Cream felt *sticky* after spreading it on, so not my favorite thing in the world. I bought it for $5 at the sample sale so I guess it's not a huge deal, but having a huge bottle of it left sucks... 

The Su:M37 Rose Stick lives up to its hype, my face feels better after just cleansing, and the smell is really nice.

shadowboxer5,"How do you cut your sheet mask? - I must have a smaller face, because if I don't cut the mask then it usually doesn't cover any of my eye area. [Here is today's mask (Tosowoong Snail).](http://imgur.com/UjpkX9C) 

Here are the pieces I cut:

* both nose/under eye connections: move the under eye part up to actually cover under my eye
* upper mouth area: I take a small chunk out to get my crow's feet area
* chin area: I take a huge chuck out and split it into two to double cover under my eyes

I find that some masks aren't the best for cutting. The Naruko snail mask works pretty well for me, but if I cut it the pieces slide around. I imagine hydrogel masks are the same?

lebeardyface,"My sordid tale; IUD, hormonal acne, and the woes of foreign language bedside manner. - WALL OF TEXT ALERT

Hi everyone!

I've never had great skin. I battled with acne in highschool, where I had huge painful cystic acne everywhere on my face but my cheeks. ReAccutane eventually wiped it out, and facials (paid for at the time by my sweet and loving mother), produced the fair, clear skin that I had dreamed of all through life.

Throughout university, things were okay, but never perfect (looking back now though, I think my skin was fine), with trenches of lows, and rollercoaster highs.

Then I moved to Korea. It was great. I could find affordable skincare, makeup, and anything my heart desired. I still got the occasional pimple around my mouth (always my biggest problem area), but it wasn't too bad. 

About a year and a half, to two years in, I went onto a non-prescription BC pill. It effed up life pretty hard, resulting in constant periods, bad skin, and emotional instability. I went to see a dermatologist who prescribed ReAccutane right off the bat, and I eventually found my way to a GYN who re-prescribed me the Yaz BC that I had taken earlier in my university days too. 

The dermatologist did not weigh me, nor calculate a dosage of ReAccutane, nor check my blood levels for liver damage, nor give me warnings about alcohol. The GYN did not ask about my sexual history, nor weight fluctuations, nor health concerns, nor headaches, nor give me warnings about smoking. Both were doctors who politely spoke back to me in Korean when I asked them questions in English, both were under foreign language hospitals here in Seoul.


My skin and my general demeanor cleared up reasonably well, but acne, acne scarring, and anything to do with my face, became sensitive issues to me. I dove into skincare and makeup like never before, carving a personal square of AB (and AM) that I had never even fathomed to exist at the time. I fell in love, I found this subreddit, and time ticked on.

Midway through last year, I started breaking out into hives and rashes on my face and body at seemingly unrelated times. I went to see a dermatologist (different to the very first one, but afterwards, the same one, every time) who spoke impeccable English and came recommended by the Internet. She assured me every time that it was the changing season, new adult allergies, the heat in my ballet class. She told me to stay inside, stop taking ballet, pop some more ReAccutane and wait it out. 

I did, and did and did. The rashes stopped. The acne... well, I guess it stopped enough to stop seeing her. Her prescriptions were only ever delivered in two week bouts, and I was always told to 'come back if there was any problem'. So I stopped going eventually.

Then I decided to get rid of my old BC and get an IUD. The beautiful little Jaydess could deliver fool-proof BC at a fractionoft the price, and maybe even eliminate my periods in the process; rad! My GYN spoke to me only in Korean, gave me no warnings, and when confronted with my questions about possible acne, only nodded, and said, 'yes, sometimes'.

I went for it. Soon, I was flushed in painful and itchy cystic acne along my jaw, neck and mouth. I'm 26 guys. I don't want to deal with this. After six weeks, I went to see my GYN again. She said, ""yes, acne"". ""Yes, maybe out"". ""Keep in for now"". ""Wait and see"".

So I went to a new dermatologist instead. He wrote me a prescription for ReAccutane (no questions asked, nor answered) although I protested and tried to explain about my IUD. My hormones. That was 3 weeks ago. On Friday I went back for another (two week) prescription, and the doctor looked me over and said to come back on Monday for an extraction.

So I did. I spent a good portion of my afternoon today in tears; getting every bit of jawline hammered at, and even a bunch of cortisone injections into my cysts to finish them off. 

Afterwards, I could not see the doctor. Afterwards, I still just had no answers and a small container of the blueish purple pills that I feel like I've been taking on and off for years now.

AB has been a sanctuary for me; a solution to all the ways I thought I couldn't control my life. But today, I sit here on my bed, and for the first time in five years, I don't want to be in Seoul. I want to go home, I want to have my mom say I'm still beautiful, and I want a doctor to treat me with compassion, and lay out an action plan for me.

I don't know my way out any more. My body doesn't feel like my own, and I feel betrayed by myself, my hormones, and this country that I love. 


This is just a wall of text, and I'm sorry if it's the wrong thing to write (Dear mods, please forgive me, or How I repented and begged for forgiveness), but I it had to be said. If anyone will understand it's you.",4812,888,asian_beauty

redpen27,"bounciness/elasticity/resilience promoting ingredient: cactus, a.k.a. prickly pear, more specifically opuntia ficus indica stem extract - ever since /u/snailslimeandbeespit clued me in to the resiliency-boosting properties of the l'herboflore aqua toner (link to review regarding the ""gym mat effect"" below), i have been dying to put some cactus extract on my face.

much googling of extracts (often sold as a hangover remedy/insulin regulator?) ensued, and much skepticism of the quality of those extracts ensued, and then much research about cactus products (and consultation of the daily help thread) ensued. here are my findings.

**CLAIMS REGARDING OFI CACTUS EXTRACT** [i don't have access to the full articles or a scientific background with which to evaluate the quality of these studies, so corrections welcome!]

-aquacacteen's makers [claim a firming effect](http://www.avgpersonalcare.it/Uploads/Brochure_AquaCacteen_Ficus_Indica.pdf) 

-[this study's abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26061570) claims ""potent antioxidant activity"" and ""may be beneficial in treating barrier-disrupted skin disorders.""

-[this one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16635743) posits that it helped rats with wound healing.

-[this study's abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25648593) claims ""moisturizing efficacy."" (fine, but yawn)

and here's a bonus: an interesting next-level suggestion from this study about [fermented](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446110) OFI extract.

**HOW MUCH OFI CACTUS EXTRACT DOES A PRODUCT NEED TO HAVE?**

the makers of aquacacteen, the cactus extract used in the l'herboflore toner (among others), [recommend](https://mibellebiochemistry.com/products/aquacacteen/) that it be used at a .5-2% level. (since the extract also contains water and glycerin, that's way less of the actual cactus, even.) that doesn't stop me, personally, from wanting way more!

And here is a pic of the free masks I‚Äôve received so far :3

(Excuse potato quality photos)

I was accidentally sent the five My Scheming black pearl masks instead of five Lovemore black pearl masks. Rather than have me send them back or offer them at a discounted price *(like certain sellers do hmp)*, Tracey told me to keep them as a gift and sent a replacement the next day :)

EDIT: forgot something super important: orders come with handwritten thank-you notes AND SWEEEETIEEES!!

**Mini-Review**

I‚Äôve tried the Cubilose, Black Pearl, Snow Lotus, Pearl Barley &amp; Milk, Wine Yeast and Rhodiola masks so far. I don‚Äôt think theres much difference between them TBH because they all leave my skin feeling really soft and hydrated. If I had to pick a fave it‚Äôd probably be Pearl Barley &amp; Milk because it feels more hydrating (I think, could be imagination) and smells sooooooo yummy. 

Fit: they‚Äôre a bit too big for me but stay in place when folded. The material is thin and comfortable so I‚Äôd recommend them to people who hate the gross suffocating feel of sheet masks.

One downside is that the masks are *really* drippy out of the packet but start to dry out after around 20 minutes. (You‚Äôre supposed to keep them on for 10-15 but I don‚Äôt follow instructions lalala) It‚Äôs always the nose bit and under-eyes that dry first while the rest of the mask is ok, so I just peel them off, pat in the leftover essence and keep it on for another 20 minutes.

**TLDR: Love Lovemore. Beautius is ~~Bae~~ Beau.**
Fantastic service, loads of freebies.
Wish I could make jokes and be funny.

rollingbarrel12,"[MINI-REVIEW]Naruko Rose &amp; Botanic HA Aqua Cubic face mask - I have ordered 30 Naruko Rose &amp; Botanic face masks from the official Naruko Ebay seller and they finally came! Although I had to pay ¬£14 because it was stuck in customs, ugh. (Original price was around ¬£24 with shipping..). Anyway, time for the review!

I have used this mask before (that's why I bought 30 of them lol ) and after having it on my face for an hour and taking it off, I can say that this mask is one of my favs now. It gives decent brightening effect or erm I'd rather say whitening?? since it evens out my skin pretty nicely but my skin did not seem THAT glowy. However,  my skin felt soft and seemed hydrated. Ok, I'm making this sound like this mask is really meh, arent I. 

The reason why I bought 30 of those masks is because of the effect on my skin the day AFTER. I put the mask in the evening and when I woke up and touched my face, I was in heaven. My skin felt really nice and soft and there was no redness on my skin. I kept touching my skin because I couldn't believe how soft it was! I'm also gonna add that the liquid sunk nicely into my skin and did not clog my pores at all (I'm very picky in terms of those ) 

I have also used the snail mask from Naruko and it was nice but it was a bit too sticky and it clogged my pores a little.  In terms of hydration, I can't tell a difference between the rose and the snail one because of how sticky it made my skin. :/",1461,292,asian_beauty

samburhan,"My experience with koreanbuddy - Hello everyone,

Normally i don't write a review but i'd like to help the vendor out
2 months ago i asked if koreanbuddy was a trusted site on reddit because you never know 



Alot of members had a good experience with koreanbuddy here so i thought id give it a try,



Chris aka medicinebottle really helped me out since i made an order of 460$ dollar with bitcoin because the conversion rate would be cheaper and the invoice would be cheaper too.

But you can also pay with either creditcard or paypal if that's easier for you just go to their site for more information,


when i send him the links of the items i wanted to order he asked me which size i wanted to pick because i wasn't 100% sure if i had the correct size.


Chris wanted to call the company himself and ask them what size was the best for me since the seller was not able to speak english  or understand me when i tried to contact them,

 I was really surprised that he wanted to do all that trouble just for an order and chris said it was no problem.


After i made the order at Koreanbuddy  chris send me a picture on dropbox of the items i purchased in a box  and then gave me my 2nd invoice. 
And trust me the shipping is really cheap and the items i got was cheaper too because he ordered them in Korea.

 I chose the 2-4 days shipping method and paid 36$ for the shipping fee to the Netherlands but if you can wait 7 days the shipping fee would be cheaper i got the tracking code yesterday and can make a picture of the package once i receive it.

also the shipping cost depends on the region you live in. 

And since my shipping was kind of cheap for a 2-4 days shipping all the way to the netherlands i was quite satisfied since from my experience eshops often ask more money than the  actual shipping fee

If you guys have any questions with my experience with koreanbuddy feel free to ask,

foir,"Actives: An AB Intro Guide and FAQ. - **What are they?**
--

""Actives"" are the common term for the group of power players in skincare with ingredients that have direct, active results on the skin, and have serious science backing it up.  These include acids like AHAs and BHAs, and antioxidants like Vitamin C and Vitamin A (retinol and tretinoin). 


**AHAs:**
--

What they do:
-
Alpha Hydroxy Acids (**AHA**) are **water-soluble** and dissolve the bonds of skin cells on the outer layers of the skin, sloughing off dead skin and the glue that holds them together. This is *not immediate*, it just speeds up the process. This helps brighten and plump skin so it is not uncommon to recommend them to users who want to **combat fine lines and signs of aging**, are looking to **reverse sun damage or hyperpigmentation**, or are seeking a **more even skin tone and texture** in general. All AHAs have humectant properties, making them particularly nice for dry skin types with continued use. They all also **increase photosensitivity**, meaning sunscreen is even more important while using an AHA! There are also sources that show that AHAs increase dermal thickness and improve collagen density as well as quality of elastic fibers. [1](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081) [2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x/abstract;jsessionid=8F1BD9BC1178A87ADF7E90B6EBD17F44.d02t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;amp;userIsAuthenticated=false) [3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;amp;userIsAuthenticated=false)

Most Common Types:
--

* **Glycolic Acid:**  It has the smallest molecules in the group so can penetrate skin deeply and easily, making it the most effective for treating fine lines, acne, blackheads, dullness, oiliness etc. An all around good choice but for its efficacy might be harsh for some, especially in the beginning during purging. Because of it's harshness, it might be better for oily skin types or users who have already built up a tolerance to AHAs. Sensitive skintypes or users who are new to acids might want to be cautious.  Glycolic Acid is **derived from cane sugar.** 

* **Lactic Acid:** Milder than glycolic but has smaller molecules than mandelic, making lactic acid kind of just the middle man in this hierarchy. Still gentle enough where sensitive skintypes won't necessarily need as much caution. Good for all skin types. **Do not use if you have milk allergies.** 

* **Mandelic Acid:** Larger molecules than both glycolic and lactic, which means it takes longer to penetrate but is also the least irritating, which is beneficial during the purge period. Ideal for very sensitive skin types. This AHA is made from almonds, so **do not use if you have nut allergies.** 

**PHAs:**
--

What they do:
--

Poly Hydroxy Acids (**PHA**)  function essentially the same as AHAs, however are far less irritating due to larger molecular structures, which limits their ability to penetrate into the skin. **Studies currently show no increased photosensitivity**, and **have been found to be compatible with clinically sensitive skin, including those with rosacea and atopic dermatitis**. All PHAs provide **humectant *and* moisturization properties** and enhanced barrier function. Most contain **antioxidants that protect cell lipids and membranes from UV damage**. In a study directly comparing AHAs to PHAs, sallowness and pinch recoil were shown to have greater improvement with AHAs but stinging and degree of sensitivity were rated worse for the AHA regimen as well. This makes PHA a great alternative and the so-called ""next gen"" of AHA.  [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15002656) [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14756648) [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15002657)

Most Common Types:
--

...I kind of feel like this is a misnomer because PHAs are overall not as common or as studied compared to BHAs and AHAs right now. Still, here's what I've found so far, I'll be adding more as I find more information on them:

* **Lactobionic Acid:** Derived from lactose, is a humectant, antioxidant and soothing. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20367666) compared lactobionic acid to glycolic acid, although I feel like it probably should be more compared to Lactic Acid. 

* **Gluconic Acid:** Also known as gluconolactone, is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. According to [this](http://128.11.40.183/lasernews/rubin_lecture/21.html), a 6% decrease in dermal penetration compared to glycolic acid. 



**BHAs:**
--

What they do:
--

While AHAs certainly aid in fighting acne, Beta Hydroxy Acids (**BHA**) are **oil-soluble** and therefore penetrate deeper in the skin, thereby degunking pores and breaking comedones. This process helps to bring things to the surface thereby making it a common suggestion for those **fighting and preventing acne** and looking for a **clearer complexion.** BHAs have no humectant properties, and are actually quite drying, making them particularly recommended to oily-skin types. BHAs **do not increase photosensitivity** with use. [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21921960) [2](https://www.drugs.com/mmx/salicylic-acid.html)

Most Common Types:
--

* **Salicylic Acid:** is really the most common BHA player in the game, and it isn't *actually* a BHA  :3  It just essentially functions as one. Salicylic acid is commonly made by acidifying sodium salicylate (which is the salt of the of the salicylate ion). You pop off the sodiums and put hydrogens on there, and voila, salicylic acid. Is in general suitable for all skin types but preferred by oily skin types.  **Do not use if you have an allergy to aspirin.**

* **Betaine Salicylate:** Essentially the salicylate is cut with betaines to provide a far more mild BHA exfoliation. Betaines are useful for helping prevent dehydration of the skin as they are larger in molecule and have a milder keratolytic effect. Suitable for all skin types but might benefit dry/dehydrated skin that find salicylic acid too drying. **Still don't use if you have an allergy to aspirin? At the very least patch test.**

**Vitamin C Serum:**
--

A comprehensive guide to vitamin c serums can be found by /u/MissPicklesMeow, [The More You Know: Vitamin C Serum FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/)

**Retinoids:**
--

What they do:
--

Retinoids slough off dead skin cells the way AHAs do, while also being anti-inflammatory, making them great for fighting **acne, anti-aging, and hyper-pigmentation.** They also function as cell-communicators: **improving the way your skin sheds and causing new skin cells to divide and function at their best** - which helps prevent premature aging and stimulate collagen. They come with anti-oxidants, but also come with a fair amount of irritation, more than the previous categories. [1](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/464026_2) [2](http://www.skinacea.com/retinoids/what-are-retinoids.html)

Most Common Types:


 * **Over-the-counter available:** From weakest to strongest: retinyl palmitate, retinol, and retinaldehyde are all available without prescriptions. Most products with retinyl palmitate are often too weak to provide any major skin benefits, especially in terms of anti-aging - Retinol takes two metabolic steps to be converted into retinoic acid, while retinyl palmitate takes three steps. 

 * **Prescription strength retinoids:** From weakest to strongest: Adapalene, Tretinoin (or retinoic acid), Tazarotene, Isotretinoin. Aside from the type of retinoid, each individual product also has its own individual retinoid concentrations. Generally, you go with the strongest retinoid you can tolerate with the least amount of irritation, even if that retinoid is considered weak. 

A note: Retinoid creams do not replace or substitute moisturizers, though you can certainly cut them into the moisturizer to try and buffer irritation.

**Commonly Asked Questions:**
--

 * ***How come there aren't that many AB options for these categories?***

Basically, there just isn't (or wasn't) a market for it. The typical consumer is not interested in any product that would cause any irritation, even if they might ultimately prove beneficial to a routine. So the AB brands shy away from it since there just isn't much money to be made from it. CosRx and others do have an online base, and so their approach and market might be slightly different, but is by and large not a reflection on the overall trends in Asia currently, though we may see changes in this in the future. 

* ***Where in my routine should these products go?***

The [Product and Routine Order FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2tokdr/product_and_routine_order_faq/) on the sidebar has this covered in detail and in resources, however the one resource I link to the most from that page is /u/fanserviced's [Visual Guide to the Korean Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3jfug1/visual_guide_to_the_korean_skincare_routine/?sort=old) which is a nice quick cheat sheet to reference. You do *not* need every step included in a routine, it just shows every possible step and where it would be included. 

* ***How often should I use these products?***

2-3 times a week is a good general frequency, seeing how your skin reacts and upping or lowering the frequency from there depending on concentration. With retinol products, depending on strength, you might want to only start with once a week. If the retinol burns, you can wash it off and try again the next night. 

* ***What about wait times?***

Wait times comes into the equation when you consider that these products are pH-dependent and work the best at specific pHs. This also dictates their product order. In following this thought process, you would have to wait 15-20  minutes after cleansing to let your skin return to its natural pH, and then 15 minutes after the application of any/every acid applied after to allow it the time to absorb and exfoliate entirely. 

That said, this topic actually gets debated every now and then. You will find users who do not adhere to any wait times and see no difference, others find that waiting can enhance exfoliation and prefer to wait for pH levels optimal for exfoliating, and other users still who will tell you that wait times led them to over-exfoliation and was too much for their skin. Potentially, not *every* skin is going to need their actives working at its most effective range,  so the tl;dr is, YMMV. Start with no wait times, at least through the purge period. As you get used to a regular exfoliation schedule and learn how your skin reacts to it, try adding in a wait time in increments of 5 minutes, up to 20 minutes. See what your skin likes best. 



* ***What exactly are pH-adjusting toners and do I need one in my routine?***

pH adjusting toners lowers the pH of your skin after cleansing, readying it for pH-dependent actives. They typically have some acids in them, but at such low concentrations that they are not effective exfoliators. 
 
We do have a [pH toner list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3e39ly/do_we_have_a_toner_ph_list_and_faq_and_if_not_can/) but I think it needs an updating - It's still quite a useful resource to find out if your toner is hydrating or pH adjusting. 

My personal conclusions from everything I've read (and I'm not an expert disclaimer goes here):

-Tap water does potentially increase the pH of the skin surface, even with a low pH cleanser. [1](http://www.sebamed.fr/client/document/effects-soap_94.pdf)

-There is a correlation between low skin surface and enhanced functions of recovery. Low pH cleansers are more important to this than water pH. [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467032)

-Starting around ages ~40+, the emphasis on needing to lower overall skin surface pH to maintain healthy barrier starts to become more important as it cannot recover as it once used to. [3](http://file.scirp.org/Html/2-1050013_7244.htm) [4](http://emjreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/Skin-pH-in-the-Elderly-and-Appropriate-Skin-Care.pdf)

-Continued use of acids can lower the skin pH overall, but overdoing it will lead to irritation. Which is why some skintypes *can't* handle it working at its most effective range, because it's overkill. Making the rise of the skin surface pH from the tap water and/or eliminating wait times fully/partially actually a good thing, because it then makes it more balanced, gentle and less effective during the ages or the skintype wherein it's more preventative rather than reactive. 

So, if you aren't reacting to your water (some people can), if you and/or your skin's age is not yet near 40, and especially if you are new to actives, I would actually suggest not even worrying about any of it yet.  Trying to go full blast when your skin doesn't need it yet is a common reason why a lot of people end up over exfoliating or experiencing irritation. As recommended above, start with no wait times until you get used to a regular schedule and see how your skin reacts to waiting. If you find you are waiting 20 minutes after cleansing, start looking at pH adjusting toners.   



* ***How do I patch test actives?***

With consideration to there being a purge period, it's a bit pointless to patch test for irritation with these products. You still need to patch test for allergy or immediate adverse reaction, which takes a 24 hour test and should be applied to a small 1"" area of the face. Once that is done and cleared you can move forward with full face, taking careful note of how your skin reacts through the purge period. 

* ***Wait, what's purging and how do I tell the difference between breaking out?***

When you use any exfoliating active - BHA, AHA, peels, or retinoids -  your skin will start to push out all the gunk from inside towards the surface. Which means if you have clogged pores, expect it to turn into whiteheads, if you have pimples, they might start looking worse. This process is called purging, can only happen with these actives (meaning **you cannot purge from a new basic moisturizer**), and details the process that **things get worse and then start getting better.** 

The time frame for seeing improvement after purging should be 3-4 weeks, but it can - with stronger actives like retinoids - take even longer - But you should still start seeing improvements by that time. My suggestion is to **wait at least one month**, taking extra care to **listen to your skin** and look out for signs that it might not be purging:

-If they get worse and stay worse, that is not purging. 

-If you start having *persistent* break outs in places that is not normal for you to break out, it is not purging (purging = short term, break out = long term).

-If you experience tiny red bumps and itching, that is probably an allergic reaction and not purging. 

-If you stop using the product and your skin immediately calms down, then your skin was experiencing irritation rather than purging. If you stop use and your skin does not calm down but stays the same, then it was purging or a breakout. If your skin feels hot, prickly, or more sensitive than usual, than it is more than likely irritation or a sign that you are over-exfoliating. 

* ***What are the signs of over-exfoliating?***

*Subtle to medium signs of over-exfoliating:* Shiny skin/forehead, increased oil production, puffiness, slight increase of sensitivity, breakouts of the small yet annoying scale, overall feeling of tightness/dryness/loss of moisture, blotchiness, patchiness, redness.

*The your-skin-is-screaming-at-you-to-stop signs:* Burning, itching, feeling of heat, extreme sensitivity, cystic eruptions. Your face will be angry, it's kind of hard to miss. 

You could show subtle to medium signs for a while and not realize it if you aren't in tune to your skin. Some people react in like a day, and that sucks but at least it's easy - others it can get bad only after a couple weeks to up to a month.


* ***I over-exfoliated :( How do I repair my barrier and how long will it take?***

Well, the first thing is to cut out all exfoliators until your skin bounces back. Then, go bland with the rest of your routine. Make sure you're washing your face with a gentle, pH-balanced cleanser and prioritize hydrating and moisturizing your face until your skin can repair itself. Ceramides, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, zinc oxide, aloe, snail are among the ingredients that will help the most during this period, so having them in your arsenal helps even before you start using actives. As far as how long it will take, be patient, it can take up to a month or more for your barrier to repair itself. 
 

* ***Are there any bad combinations or ingredients that shouldn't go together?***

-Copper peptides and vitamin C can cancel each other out 
[1](http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/content/94/4/1259.short) but other sources say it's likely a myth and needs further study. 

-Niacinamide can cause flushing in some people when introduced to acidic pHs, particularly L-AA vitamin c serums, but not everybody is sensitive to this. If you find you are sensitive, a 20 minute wait time between products should be enough to combat this. Have two opposing sources on this topic:  [1](http://kindofstephen.com/can-you-use-niacinamide-and-vitamin-c-ascorbic/) [2](https://www.futurederm.com/should-niacinamide-and-l-ascorbic-acid-be-used-together/)

-Retinoids and waxing do not go together. Even at low strengths, you can irritate and/or lift skin when waxing while having a retinoid in your routine. Your esthetician should ask you beforehand. 

-Benzoyl peroxide can render topical tretinoin ineffective, but the combo is okay when formulated properly to be together [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958193/)

-Seriously, make sure you're wearing sunscreen if you are using AHAs or retinoids. I mean, you should be diligent about sunscreen anyways, but seriously guis. You'll do more damage than good if you begin use of these products and do not use sunscreen. 

-When starting multiple actives, it's mostly just common sense that dictates to ease in very slowly. Retinol especially, you might want to cut out all actives for a while and re-introduce them later once you've built some tolerance. It isn't so much that it's bad to have it in one routine, it's just way easier to experience over-exfoliation and irritation. You want to avoid that by practicing caution and going slow. 


* ***Do PoC and/or darker skin tones benefit from a certain types more than others?***

I've found hearsay about how darker skin tones tend to prefer glycolic acid over others, and I've found hearsay that has said that PoC tend to experience more irritation than others when using acids to the point where glycolic is even discouraged. So. I wanted to address all of these notes specifically with some extra research, and have found the following:

There *is* [a larger risk of PIH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921758/pdf/jcad_3_7_20.pdf) in regards to use of acids in any large percentage, ie, chemical peels. 


As far as overall irritation and risk, here is a study on the [effect on Asian skin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9107290), one targeting the [effect on darker skin tones of Indians with melasma](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12269877), and one [comparing glycolic to mandelic](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1524-4725.2008.34383.x/full) - In this the combination of mandelic *and* salicylic proved more effective but took longer to showcase than simply using glycolic. All of these studies say yay. good to go on using acids. I also found [salicylic was safe and improved acne and hyperpigmentation in darker racial ethnic groups](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9935087). So, aside from the risk of PIH cited from the first study, no further risk for irritations should be expected compared to other groups, nor is one acid shown to be more favorable than another? At least not from what I've found?

In [Management of hyperpigmentation in darker racial ethnic groups](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19608057) ([full text here](http://www.obgynnews.com/fileadmin/content_pdf/san/scms_pdf/Vol28_i2_Hyperpigmentation.pdf)) it's concluded that ""Given the propensity of darker skin to hyperpigment, peeling agents and resurfacing procedures should be used with care and caution. Maximal results are best achieved with repetitive, superficial, resurfacing modalities."" 

So with all that, I would say it's not a matter of one acid being better than another for darker skin tones, or that they experience more irritation. They do however have to **take special care and caution for melasma and hyperpigmentation, and in that it's moreso the method than the acid- Lower percentages for long term maintenance are more ideal than higher percentages for short term resurfacing and peels.** If anyone has further research, insights, or thoughts on this subject I'd love to hear about it!

rightrough,"This article claims that chemical sunscreens produce free radical damage. What do you think? - [This](http://beautyeditor.ca/2016/06/18/chemical-free-sunscreen) is the article in question. The article gives several reasons for this. It claims that chemical sunscreens are not very healthy  for your skins and one of the reason is that they can amplify free radical production :

&gt;Another problem with chemical sunscreen is that it's linked to oxidative damage, thanks to inadequate protection from UVA rays.[...] 
Because some sunscreen chemicals are not very photostable, they can amplify free radical production, releasing these harmful byproducts when they absorb UVA energy. In fact, this study found that some chemical filters may cause more free radicals to form than no sunscreen at all!

The article doesn't sound like an advertisement to me personally and they even cite a study from the University of California about this. 

With chemical sunscreens being such a popular AB product I wonder what do you think? Do you feel like they provide adequate protection or do you feel better protected with a physical sunscreen? 

Personal anecdote: I used to use the popular Biore Watery gel sunscreen for about a year and it was the first sunscreen I wore regularly but it didn't feel like enough. On my oily skin it felt like nothing after about an hour and I also found out that it doesn't protect very well against UVA I rays. This is why a lot of people tend to call it an indoors sunscreen. I now switched to a combination of chemical and physical sunblock in the form of Boots  Soltan Dry touch and while it's not as cosmetically elegant it does the job and I do feel like I get extra protection without the dryness caused by the alcohol. But I'm curious if there's any AB physical sunscreens out there with a decent amount of Zinc Oxide?",1850,309,asian_beauty

tobiasfunkeAT,"New design for Laneige BB Cushion Pore Control #21 - Pictures, swatches, review, and comparisons - Hi AB, 

I recently received my haul from TesterKorea and noticed that they redesigned their bb cushion cases. I'm a new AB convert and have only tried a few bb creams. I relied heavily on swatches, reviews, and recommendations from this community in order to pick out the right product and shade, so I wanted to add my own to help someone else too. 

My skin type: Very oily, very dehydrated, and very acne-prone (hormonal mostly) Shade: NC20-25


Entire Albumn: http://imgur.com/a/tLGVc

Laneige BB Cushion Pore Control #21

http://www.laneige.com/int/en/product/makeup/face/view.bb-cushion-pore-control.cushion.html

Design: I am very pleased with the aesthetic design of the case. There is a ring of soft mint around a minimalistic iridescent background. Oooooh pretty @_@. It's sturdy and well-built. It'll be a nice accessory to carry around in my purse. 

This is the first time I've bought this product. I have previously tried the regular Laneige BB cushion in #21, but I ended up giving away that case and extra refill to my friend as it could not endure more than 4-5 hours of normal wear on my oil field of a face. It was a good quality product, but definitely just not for my skin type.

The pore control formula is great. The color match is amazing on my olive toned NC 20-25 skin. It does look slightly too light on the periphery of my face, which is easily fixed with a minimal amount of bronzer. The formula is definitely not as high-coverage as I was expecting, and is not as heavy as the regular Laneige bb cushion, but I don't mind, as it does look more natural. Plus, it's actually pretty buildable. It's also got a clean, fresh fragrance that dissipates after a few minutes. This will last 8-10+ hours in a normal work day. It wears off slightly, but gracefully. It's something that I've only had a few western foundations be able to do in the past. By the end of the day, the foundation doesn't rub off or settle into my pores. My skin looks reasonably good, and helped keep the integrity of my blush and bronzer. This is also great for touch-ups, and blends seamlessly into existing foundation. Rating: 4/5 coverage 1-2 layers, 5/5 coverage with 3-4 layers, 4.5/5 color match, 4.5/5 longevity on oily skin, semi-matte finish. 

This is my first time using the pore control formulation so I can't comment personally about how it compares to the old pore control version. It appears that this product was reformulated, and I've looked up the ingredients on both the versions for those curious: 

Ingredients- New 2016 formulation, from the Laneige International website: 

Purified Water, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methyl Trimethicone, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Niacinamide, Nylon-12, HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer, Pinus sylvestris Leaf Extract,  Dimethicone,  Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Manganese Sulfate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Chloride, Stearic Acid, Silica, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Acrylates/Stearyl Acrylate/Dimethicone Methacrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/Ethylhexyl Acrylate/Dimethicone Methacrylate Copolymer, Aluminum Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Zinc Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Chenopodium quinoa Seed Extract, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Peppermint Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Polypropylsilsesquioxane, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Phenoxyethanol, Yellow Oxide of Iron, Red Oxide of Iron, Black Oxide of Iron, Aromatics

Ingredients- previous formulation, from the Laneige US website: 

Water, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methyl Trimethicone, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Arbutin, Nylon-12, HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer, Sodium Chloride, Sorbitan Isostearate, Acrylates/Ethylhexyl Acrylate/Dimethicone Methacrylate Copolymer, Aluminum Hydroxide, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Stearic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Melia Azadirachta Extract, Salicylic Acid, Alcohol, Protease, CI 77492, CI 77491, CI 77499, Fragrance 

*On a quick scan, it appears that they have replaced arbutin with Niacinamde. The new version also has added ascorbyl glucoside, and has taken out Salicylic acid.

Comparing the old sponge and case, it appears that the new sponge is about 10% smaller. The new cushion itself has a new fishnet design. The sponge feels much more dense. The old refills **DO NOT** fit into the new cases. The new refill also likely **DO NOT** fit into the old cases. I tried to put the new refill into my espoir case, which the old Laneige refill fit perfectly into, and it is too wide to fit. 

Color matching:
It looks like this foundation will be available in 12 shades, which is kind of unheard of for a bb cream :) It features different shades for cool and warm undertones for the lighter shades, as well as very dark options for darker skin tones.

lili_misstaipei,"Dr. Wu Whitening System - I was feeling down so I made a trip to Watson's and browsed the more expensive side of the store.  I'm pregnant so my routine has been cut to bare bones clindamycin, niacinimide, and arbutin products (clindamycin, Hada Labo, blue bottle; HL 5-in-1 gel white jar moisturizer, HL SPF, full stop) but I was thinking I need some exfoliation or maybe a Vitamin C serum for a few spots.  

Low and behold, Watson's is having a great sale on even the expensive stuff and I walked out with two bottles of Dr Wu's Whitening System toner and one bottle of the Whitening System serum for a very pretty USD$45 (~$100 msrp).

I thought AB readers would be interested to know that the Dr Wu Whitening System uses three vitamin c derivatives so therefore the pH can be higher (~5.5 to 6), is far more stable than L-AA (OST for example), does not require high concentrations, and is great for sensitive skin.  Further, one of the great ingredients in the system is Azeloyl Glycine which is a new chemical form of the traditional azelaic acid, superior because it also does not need a low pH (basically not pH-dependent at all, in fact) and is more gentle and effective than azelaic acid.  Then of course there is the licorice extract to make you even happier.  Both the toner and the serum seem to be moisturizing on their own as well.

Icing on the cake, the Dr Wu brand is fragrance and (generally) alcohol free.  Basically no additives and fillers to be found.  

So, while I haven't had the chance to use the system longer than a week and a half, I can say there is no scent, very little if any residue after application, and has already resulted in a tiny bit of exfoliation (ie two blackheads mysteriously appeared and basically fell out of my face; that hasn't happened since before my pregnancy).

I went ahead and bought a bottle on Amazon Prime Pantry because it was only $3.99 through Prime Pantry, and I had a $5.99 Pantry credit that nullified the $5.99 shipping charge, so I'll test it and post a review after I have a chance to try it out, but I just wondered if any of you were using this. 

Hell, if it does nice things to my skin, I'll keep buying it and just use it as a body wash too.

psthrowaway5572,"My experience getting cosmetic surgery (hairline transplant) in Seoul - 
Hi guys! I‚Äôm using a throwaway because I don‚Äôt want my plastic surgery to be associated with my main account when my friends know my reddit handle. There seems to be some interest in plastic surgery on this sub, so I wanted to share my experience here. 

**Disclaimer:** I‚Äôm not a promoter for plastic surgery nor do I advocate it, blablabla, I‚Äôm posting here simply because I love the ab community here, I‚Äôm in Seoul alone (and will be here for the next couple weeks) so might as well kill some time!! 
(Also I know that there is a more common internet forum for Asian plastic surgery on Purseforum but I just don‚Äôt really like using the interface there. Reddit is my internet home. I may post there in due time.)

**Why I got a hairline transplant** I have a pretty big forehead. I thought it made my facial proportions look quite off, and I didn‚Äôt like looking so different when my hair was tied up. I also felt like it was making my face look bigger. My features seemed to be concentrated in [the center of my face](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/43/e1/a0/43e1a061185e5dc2b76a10d180a6f461.jpg), there was just so much space around my features if that makes sense. I thought that getting a hairline transplant would reduce that appearance. 

**Why I chose to go to South Korea:** I‚Äôm not Korean, but I do live in an East Asian country. Going to Seoul is fast and not especially expensive for me. The prices are good, and I feel better going to a clinic in a country that has such a big plastic surgery market, because it means the surgeons have more practice. 

**How much did it cost?** I‚Äôm not willing to share publicly, but I got a good deal. I went on [babitalk](https://babitalk.com) which is like a groupon for plastic surgery, as ridiculous as that sounds. It‚Äôs all in Korean though, so it‚Äôs pretty difficult to navigate. Google translate doesn‚Äôt help much, because Korean websites tend to put a lot of text information into images. So Google translate doesn‚Äôt work on that. However, if you use the mobile app you can take a photo of those pictures, though that is pretty time consuming. Anyway, since it‚Äôs all in Korean, using it will get you a ‚Äòlocal‚Äôs price‚Äô (clinics tend to charge more for foreigners). I don‚Äôt think you can get the deal anymore. Someone asked for a price quote after they heard I was going to this clinic, and they got quoted a price like 1000USD higher than mine. 

**Where did you go?** I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm not willing to share publicly :(  I know it‚Äôs super annoying but I really do not want to be accused as a promoter. Also, the clinic doesn‚Äôt have an English translator present, and none of its website is in English. It‚Äôs not one of those clinics that are aimed at foreigners (except for Chinese people). I had to bring my own translator along. 

**Why did you choose that clinic then?** 

1. The price. 

2. The reviews were good (I read the reviews on [soyoung](https://soyoung.com), a Chinese review site). I also liked their before and afters on their website. 

3. The doctor will doing every step of the hair harvesting and transplant, and not a nurse/technician. 

4. They do FUE, which I consider the ideal method (through internet research and not professional opinion). 

5. The way they harvest hair is in a sort of zipper like pattern, so there will not be a thick, noticeable bald line if someone should ever lift up your hair at that particular spot. 

6. Most Western clinics are aimed at men, but there was equal emphasis placed on men and women on the website of the clinic. In fact, the babitalk deal I saw only had pictures of women.



**Booking, consultation and surgery**

I‚Äôm going to be super detailed cause I know for my first procedure I was really sweating the small silly stuff, like how to enter the clinic and let them know who you are and stuff. It‚Äôs just that I read so many online experiences about getting the procedures itself in Korea, but little about what happens before it. 

I contacted the clinic on their kakao, saying that I have seen their babitalk deal. I contacted them in Korean using my translator. Their deal was back in March, and I asked if I could have the deal in May. They said yes, if I paid a 500k won deposit. I did, using bitcoin (my first time using bitcoin!) since I didn‚Äôt know any other way of transferring money since my bank is not Korean. They do not accept PayPal. 

I arrived at 9:40AM with my translator. The lady at the counter greeted us. I said my name, she recognized me, and told us to sit down and gave us a few basic forms to fill in. 

After a few minutes, I was led to a recovery room with a bed and a small wardrobe with my surgery robe and slippers to change into. I left my clothes and belongings in the wardrobe. It ended up not being lockable so I gave it to the consultant for safekeeping ‚Äì my reasoning was if I trust them with my health/body, I trust them with my bag haha. 

I was then led to another room, accompanied by my translator. The consultant then started talking to me about my concerns, and showing me some before and after pictures. I also asked a few basic questions (which I don‚Äôt really remember now). I asked about baby hairs because I like the look of them, and she said that they sort the hairs by thickness and transplant the thinnest hairs closest o the face to mimic baby hairs. Anyway, she said that I had a wide forehead, and told me information about the procedure I already knew.

I then paid the consultant in cash. I knew the price beforehand, so I had counted out the money and separated them into bundles of 1 million won. My translator asked if I could get 10% off because of the tax refund, and she said yes. 

After, the consultant led us to a room with the doctor. The consultant had to leave sometimes, but she stayed for about 70% of the time. 

The doctor said that I had a wide but short forehead, which surprised me. I always thought I had a wide and tall forehead. He said that my forehead was actually about 0.5-1cm shorter than average. The consultant said earlier that my forehead juts out a bit at the top right underneath my hairline, which makes it look taller, which the doctor agrees with.

He drew a design on my forehead using marker. The design is deliberately a choppy line, to mimic a natural hairline. Once he‚Äôs done, he asked what I thought about it, and I said it could be drawn lower and he does that. He also mentions that during the procedure, they‚Äôll stop when they‚Äôre nearly done and ask the patient to choose whether to continue or not. Usually, once the patient sees the hair actually in, they‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs a significant difference and not want the hairline lowered further.

The doctor also took photos of me in various angles.

The consultant then bought me to the surgery room, where the nurses take my blood. 

I lied face-down on a pillow with a hole in it so they can extract the hair from the back of my scalp (around the same height as where your ears are). They shave my hair (which is an interesting feeling, seeing I‚Äôve never shaved my head before!) Then the doctor injected local anesthetic which HURT SO MUCH. I thought I had a high pain tolerance but oh man. I thought the needles were boring into my skull. They had to numb a large area too, so there were like 20 injections. However, nearing the end of the injections, they started hurting less because the anesthetic is kicking in. 

Then they start extracting the hair. I couldn‚Äôt feel anything at all so pretty much zoned out for 20 minutes. Then they stitched and bandaged me up. When I got up I almost fell though, don‚Äôt know if that has to do with anything. There was also a pile of bloody gauze and a clump of my hair in the bin. 

Now it‚Äôs time for transplanting the hair. I‚Äôm now on my back, they lightly sedate me. Sedation is optional, it just makes your mind woozy and sleepy so time passes faster. The full procedure is 4 hours, but it felt like 2. I had my first trippy experience haha, but I didn‚Äôt the last time I got sedated. Felt like the changing geometrical shapes from The Less I Know the Better music video by Tame Imapala haha. 

Back on track. They cover your eyes with a cloth (to protect you from bright lights and also stop you from awkwardly staring at the doctor/nurses since you have nothing else to do haha) but you can hear everything. It sounds like staples when they transplant the hair follicle into your skin. Since I‚Äôm a creepo and I was trying to see everything that was going on under the cloth, I gleaned that the doctor was doing the transplanting. One nurse was responsible for passing the hair follicles (which are in this plastic syringe looking thing) and adjusting them so they can be used by the doctor immediately, and then disposing it somewhere as soon as the doctor was done (there are thousands of hair follicles to be transplanted, so she works quick). Another nurse was sitting at the side who seemed to be sorting out follicles by size. I could hear another nurse as well, but don‚Äôt know what he/she was doing. Also, they listen to kpop and some radio show while they operate on you.

Aside from sounding like staples, it feels like someone‚Äôs stapling you too. But it doesn‚Äôt hurt. Like it feels like someone put a layer of cloth against your skin and was stapling that, so you feel it but it doesn‚Äôt hurt at all. Twice during the early stages of the procedure, I let the doctor know that I could feel a tiny bit of pain (like a 2/10 on the pain scale, nothing compared to the local anesthetic injections earlier ) and he would inject local anesthetic and it would go away pretty much instantly. 

This continued for quite a long time. 

Then suddenly they were telling me to sit up, and my awesome translator was back (they had told her to come back 4 hours later). They handed me a mirror and I was pretty shocked ‚Äì my forehead looked so small now! In fact, it looked too small. 

I was kind of in shock. I looked around a bit and realized that my forehead really is of an average size now (in fact, I‚Äôd still say it‚Äôs slightly larger than my ideal) but I just wasn‚Äôt used to it because I was used to seeing myself with such a large forehead. My consultant came over and said that more could be added to the sides, which I agreed with. So they lay me down again and had another 5 minute of transplanting, and I was happy. 

Went back to the recovery room, but no downtime is really needed. I just got changed, got my pills and aftercare instructions from a nurse, who also gave me a hilarious badass rapper looking beanie which I could wear back when in public. Thank god I lived a walking distance away! 

I can wash my hair everyday, just gently. They also provide professional hair washing services, which I‚Äôm doing tomorrow. My stitches from the back of my head will be removed in 10 days. 


The transplanted hair is about an inch long right now. They will fall out after 2 weeks, and then it‚Äôll look like I never had a hair transplant. Then 3-4 months later, they‚Äôll start growing back.

solskinnratel,"Recommend Me A Product: Sulfate Free Dandruff-Control Shampoo! - I have dyed hair- it's an obvious purple color in a balayage (so like,it's NOT at my roots- it fades from my natural color to the purple so it grows out nicely) and cost me 6-7 hours in a salon chair without breaks and a nice little sum of money, so I need to do everything I can to protect the color, including sulfate free products on my hair. I know a lot of ""color care"" shampoos DO have sulfate in them, but I noticed my color fading faster with those than with sulfate-free but not labeled ""color care"" shampoos. SO anyway.

I tend to get dandruff, but previously, washing my hair about every other day, it wasn't too bad as I could easily wash it out. I always kept zinc shampoo on hand if it was bad. NOW, though, I go 4-7 days between washes- I try for 7, but the dandruff gets out of control by day 4. I did buy a dandruff shampoo again, a western one from American Crew, but the sulfates again just stripped my color. Yesterday, I did a 1-hr color-depositing conditioner treatment (I make my own), and then washed my hair (I only put shampoo in my roots, never down the lengths). I noticed that even after this, I had HORRIBLE dandruff. We're talking like, ""make my hair look grey up top"" dandruff.

I tried to find an anti-dandruff shampoo without sulfates in it, and came up basically blank. Even if they don't have SLS in them, there is still SOME sulfate. So.. thought I'd ask AB for recommendations :)",1482,276,asian_beauty

aleebsi,"Dear Sephora, I am disappointed. - So... today, I was at the mall, checking out the new Shoe Carnival, seeing if they had any shoes that would look nice for my wedding in November (spoiler: they didn't, their selection sucked). Whenever I go to the mall, I swing by Sephora because... I really enjoy being broke, I guess? Anyway.

I made my way through the tiny Sephora, sampling cool things (mostly foundations and lipsticks), and made it through WITHOUT BUYING ANYTHING. YES! I AM NOT WEAK!

And then, as I left... the sample kits. You know the ones, with a variety of DS of various things. It's like kryptonite for my poor debit card. However, I stayed strong and decided that I did not need 3 DS lipsticks or a Clarisonic Mia. I was so close... and then I spotted a summer skincare sampler, in a reusable clear bag, and a little blue squeeze tube with white font that said ""Shiseido"". Yes, my fellow snailbees, a summer skincare sample set that included Shiseido. But I grit my teeth and said ""NO! I do not need to spend $27 to get a DS of Shiseido Suncream! I'm leaving!"" (in my head, of course, I'm not that crazy).

Then, I looked at the bag next to it, and saw a Dr. Jart+ BB cream. Curious, I picked up the first one... and turned it around. And there, on the other side, was the other samples, including that BB cream. And I failed, starfishes and milky piggies. I grabbed that kit and went right back into the store.

But I got to the counter, super excited to make my purchase, and when the sales girl scanned it... she said she couldn't sell it to me. Apparently, it wasn't supposed to be released yet! I pouted and pointed out that they had 15 of them on display, and she promised to take them down. They aren't even available on the website.

I even asked nicely, but she wouldn't take my money. I wish I had pictures of the kit. It had other great non-AB products in it, too, like Algenist, St. Tropez, FRESH, and Too Faced. All DS, no foils.

I went home, defeated, and am comforting myself with Fiddy's pore cleansing method.

The only things I received for writing this review are firm, bouncy skin and a sore wrist.]**

**[Also, there aren't any photos because it's evening here, and there are too many shadows, but I link to some sites where you can see pictures.]**

On a trip to Taiwan last October, I sought out the L‚ÄôHerboflore stand in the Taipei 101 building, eager to get my hands on some sheet masks. Much to my surprise, I discovered that L‚ÄôHerboflore carries a lot of products that aren‚Äôt sheet masks, such as cleansers, a toner, eye cream, exfoliating gel, moisturizers, body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and powdered health drinks. I purchased a couple of these non-sheet mask items that I‚Äôll review down the road (I still need to finish testing them), and I‚Äôve been impressed enough with them that when I saw that the U.S. site Beautibi stocks some L‚ÄôHerboflore products, I decided to order the Aqua Plus Moisturizing Toner, something I regretted not picking up in Taipei. Aside from the fact that L‚ÄôHerboflore products have impressed me, I was eager to incorporate more Taiwanese products, other than sheet masks, into my routine, since T-Beauty doesn‚Äôt get as much love around here as products from Korea, and to a lesser extent, Japan. 

*The low-down: what is this product?*

The L‚ÄôHerboflore ËïæËàíÁø†  [Aqua Plus Moisturizing Toner Ê∞¥ÁõàÊΩ§Êô∂Èú≤](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_detail.aspx?series=9&amp;classid=29&amp;id=88)   (hereafter known as Aqua Toner) is a hydrating toner that is part of [L‚ÄôHerboflore‚Äôs Aqua Plus line](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=9&amp;classid=29), which features products made from organic cactus elixir. The company claims that this toner will soothe irritated skin, hydrate one‚Äôs skin, and protect and firm one‚Äôs skin. 

*Ingredients:*

(I don‚Äôt know if Taiwanese ingredients are listed in the same order as in the U.S., so I‚Äôm not sure how important the order is here; list is taken from the product box, which is slightly different from the Beautibi website) 

Aqua (Water), Propanediol, Glycosyl Trehalose, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glycerin, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Polysaccharides, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Fragrance, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, O-CYMEN-5-OL. 

I put the ingredients into [Cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_479b233703.html). Please keep in mind that just because something isn‚Äôt flagged in Cosdna doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt be a problem for you. Similarly, Cosdna often flags things that are generally safe as being potentially unsafe as it doesn‚Äôt take into account the small concentration used in skin care products. In any case, please do not use this product if you have a known allergy or sensitivity to any of the above ingredients, and always patch test and isolation test new products. 

*According to Cosdna, the potentially acne-causing/unsafe ingredients (anything flagged a 3 or higher) are:*

**Propylene glycol**, which is a humectant, receives a 3 for safety. Some people claim that it‚Äôs the same thing as antifreeze and that it‚Äôs a strong skin irritant. Paula‚Äôs Choice rates it as Good and explains that it‚Äôs used only in a tiny amount in skin care products (versus the amount you would find in antifreeze) and thus should not be an issue, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does not deem it carcinogenic. You‚Äôll find this ingredient in a lot of products, including baby wipes, lip sticks, shampoos and conditioners, and moisturizers. I‚Äôve seen it in a lot of my other products, and I‚Äôm still alive. 

The only potential acne trigger is **Triethanolamine**, which is pretty low at 2, but gets a 5 for safety. What is this supposedly dangerous substance? Triethanolamine is primarily used to adjust pH, but it also functions as an emulsifier. It‚Äôs found in various cosmetics, hair products, shaving creams, and sunscreens, in addition to some skin care products. The FDA has approved it as being safe for use as long as it is in a concentration below 5%. Various sources I checked said that in spite of the FDA approval, it shouldn‚Äôt be used long term. Paula‚Äôs Choice doesn‚Äôt seem to think it‚Äôs an issue and ranks it as Good, since the concentration used in cosmetics and skin care is low. I don‚Äôt know what the percentage is here, but I‚Äôm going to assume it‚Äôs less than 5%. 

**PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil** gets a 3 for safety. An emollient ingredient, Paula‚Äôs Choice gives it a rating of Good, though there are plenty of sites that are suspicious of it and recommend that is not be used on damaged or injured skin. 

**Fragrance** is flagged as being 1-4 in terms of safety, but we have no idea what kind of fragrance is being used here, or what concentration. I can say that the scent is rather light and dissipates quickly, so I don‚Äôt see fragrance as being an issue for most people with this product. 

**Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate**, a water-based preservative found in a wealth of skin care products and cosmetics, as well as many other products, gets a 4-6 for safety. It earns a Good from Paula‚Äôs Choice, and as the concentration used is likely very small, it shouldn‚Äôt be a concern for most people. I like my preservatives. 

Okay, those are the ‚Äúflagged‚Äù ingredients. After doing my own research on them, I‚Äôm not concerned that I‚Äôm about to melt off my face or contract cancer from using this product, but I am not a medical or scientific expert. Use this product at your own risk. 

*Onto the GOOD ingredients!*

Our star is the **organic cactus extract**, or **Opuntia ficus-indica stem extract** (also known as **prickly pear extract**). I have no idea what the concentration is. According to multiple sources, cactus extract is supposed to be good for moisturizing, protecting, soothing, and firming. It‚Äôs also rich in antioxidants and fatty acids. Native Americans allegedly used cactus to treat burns.  (Side note: it‚Äôs also edible, and used in a variety of juices, jellies, alcoholic drinks, candies, and teas). Cactus extract contains Vitamin E, which helps soften skin, and Vitamin K, which helps reduce the appearance of dark circles and promote skin elasticity. It‚Äôs known for its anti-inflammatory properties, which makes it good for sensitive skin. It‚Äôs also high in essential fatty acids. It‚Äôs thought to be suitable for all skin types and especially good for mature and sensitive skin. (There are too many articles here to list, but if you search for ‚Äúprickly pear‚Äù or ‚ÄúOpuntia ficus-indica stem extract‚Äù or ‚Äúcactus‚Äù and ‚Äúskin care,‚Äù you‚Äôll find a lot of interesting results.) Spoiler alert: using my own face as a test study, this ingredient lives up to all of its hype (except the dark eye circles, which I don‚Äôt have, so I don‚Äôt know how well it works on those). I could keep raving about this ingredient, but let‚Äôs move on so we can get to the actual product. 

Another notable ingredient is **aloe barbadensis leaf polysaccharides**, which is a known anti-irritant and also helps restore suppleness. My sensitive skin loves aloe, so this is another plus for me. 

Another good ingredient is **panthenol**, a humectant that‚Äôs an alcohol form of the B vitamin pantothenic acid.

And then there‚Äôs **dipotassium glycyrrhizate**, which is a fancy way of referring to **licorice root extract**. As many of us licorice root fans know, licorice root is anti-inflammatory and an anti-irritant and has been known to work as a brightening agent and to help reduce the redness and irritation associated with rosacea and acne. I have mild rosacea, so I am thrilled that this ingredient is included. 

**Sodium hyaluronate**, a water-soluble salt form of our pal hyaluronic acid, is another winner. It has a smaller molecular size than hyaluronic acid, and thus is able to more easily penetrate the skin, and like HA, it is able to hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. There are many more great things I could say about this product, but most of us are familiar with the benefits of hyaluronic acid. 

**Sclerocarya birrea seed oil**, also known as **Marula oil**, is predominantly oleic acid, and it also contains stearic, linoleic, and palmitic acids. It is an antiaging oil that hydrates, protects, and rejuvenates skin. 

So as you can see, this toner is chock full of lots of great ingredients, and in spite of Cosdna‚Äôs flagging some of the ingredients for safety (which doesn‚Äôt concern me after doing my own research), nothing is flagged as being potentially irritating, and there‚Äôs only one potential acne trigger, with a rating of 2 (very low). That said, please remember that YMMV. 

*Packaging:*

Aqua Toner comes in a sleek 4.05 fl. oz./120 mL airless white pump that I think is made of plastic (at least on the outside). The only negative I would say about the container is that you can‚Äôt see how much product you have left, but I suppose the old flashlight trick would work. The product dispenses easily. 

*pH:*

I tested the pH, and it comes out to about 5. Perfectly acceptable in my book for a hydrating toner, though probably too high to be a pH-adjusting toner. 

*Texture and fragrance:*

The product is a clear gel with a very faint scent‚Äîit‚Äôs hard for me to say what it smells like. I want to say ‚Äúcactus,‚Äù but I have no idea what cactus smells like. It strangely reminds me of the scent of Aussie Sprunch Spray in the purple bottle, but much lighter. I don‚Äôt find it overpowering or irritating, and it dissipates pretty quickly once the product is absorbed. I was surprised to see that the product is a gel, as it‚Äôs my first time to use a gel toner, but the gel quickly melts into the skin.

*How to use:*

The instructions on the bottle read (in English): ‚ÄúUse morning and evening after cleansing. Take 2-3 pumps to a cotton pad and smooth over face and neck.‚Äù (The instructions on the box are in Chinese and say the same thing.) If you use a First Essence, you may wish to use the FTE first if you follow the ‚Äúthinnest to thickest rule.‚Äù At the same time, I have mixed feelings about this, as this product is a great booster for other products, so if you use the Aqua Toner first, your FTE might absorb better. You could play around with it and see what you prefer. Since it‚Äôs a gel, I don‚Äôt use a cotton pad, which seems like it would waste a lot of precious product‚ÄîI generally squirt a pump or two onto my hand and apply to one section of my face at a time, patting in with my fingertips, then moving onto the next section. I probably divide my face into three sections (so anywhere from 3-6 pumps of product used at one time), but then I apply the toner around my eye area as well. I‚Äôm liberal with it around my eyes because I‚Äôve had such amazing results, as detailed below. I use it both morning at night. The product absorbs pretty quickly, so you don‚Äôt have to wait too long to continue your routine. It might even absorb more quickly than other toners I‚Äôve used. 

*How I tested this product + my impressions:*

I started testing this toner back in late February/early March, but when my skin broke out in hives due to an unrelated reaction from a hair product getting on my face, I had to reset my routine from zero and put this toner on hold. This meant I wasn‚Äôt using any toner for most of March, and in early April I only used Evian mist (pure water) as my toner. When it came time to add a proper toner back into my routine during the last third of April, I reached for the Aqua Toner, since my other sensitive skin toners (Acwell and Klairs) were near-empty, and the ingredients list looked pretty clean. I was quite apprehensive, since I was still haunted by memories of itchy, angry red hives, and I was afraid of a relapse. Fortunately, the Aqua Toner got along well with my skin and caused absolutely no negative reaction (no breakouts, no irritation, nada). 

I tested it about a week over my entire face, and I thought my skin seemed suppler, but to test my hunch, for a couple of days after, I only applied the Aqua Toner to the left side of my face, and I applied my almost-empty bottle of Whamisa Organic Flowers Deep Rich Essence Toner to the right side. The difference was palpable after a couple of days: my left side was softer, bouncier, and much more pleasant to touch, and my left cheek was less red and irritated (I have sensitive skin and mild rosacea, and my cheeks gets irritated just by existing). The right side of my face became very jealous from all the attention lavished upon my left, and so I aborted my split-face experiment before a week had elapsed‚ÄîI wanted that bounciness all over. 

The more I use this product, the more I love it. I‚Äôve probably used it for about 3 ¬Ω weeks, not including my first testing round that was cut short due to hives. I still have a pretty minimalist routine (no ampoules/essences/serums except for my beloved Shark Sauce), but you‚Äôd never know it. I even stopped using my First Essence and am just using the Aqua Toner to prep my skin, and I still have The Glow (granted, Shark Sauce is probably also giving me The Glow, so maybe this comment is less about the Aqua Toner and more about the inefficacy of my current FTE). But the best thing is I have that Gym Mat Effect‚Äîdo you remember the mats you used in gym class when you did gymnastics? That‚Äôs how my skin feels: firm yet soft, and bouncy. QQ, as the Taiwanese say. Now, I have a couple of other products that help with the Gym Mat Effect (Shark Sauce, L‚ÄôHerboflore Flora Supreme Recovery Infusion Cr√®me), but when I feel my face after applying the Aqua Toner and before applying those other products, I still have the coveted Gym Mat Effect. I feel like a narcissist because I can‚Äôt stop touching my face. I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm single because someone else needs to be stroking my Gym Mat Face. 

Another perk of this toner is that it helps to minimize the fine lines around my eyes. I‚Äôm in my 30s, and thanks to my oily T-zone, my forehead is still smooth, but I have pesky fine lines in the corners and underneath my yes. My eye cream helps a little bit, but this toner makes the lines almost non-existent (almost‚Ä¶you can still see they‚Äôre there, but they‚Äôre way less visible). The effect also gets better each day; the past couple of mornings, I‚Äôve awakened to a very smooth, almost line-free eye area, and it‚Äôs stunning. I can‚Äôt help but wonder what amazement would happen if I had a better eye cream to work in conjunction with this toner (I do have the eye cream in the same line, but I‚Äôm waiting to use up my lackluster Whamisa eye essence before I start the new product‚ÄîI hope the Aqua line eye cream won‚Äôt disappoint). This is where the toner exceeds my expectations: I expect my toner to hydrate and prep my skin for the additional goodness that‚Äôs going to come its way, and if I‚Äôm greedy, I might expect my toner to be soothing, and I definitely expect my toner NOT to irritate my skin, but it never occurred to me that I could expect my toner to help diminish the appearance of fine lines. I thought that‚Äôs what fancy serums were for. (Let‚Äôs be clear: the lines are still there, but my skin is so plumped with hydration that you can‚Äôt see them that well‚Äîafter all, this product doesn‚Äôt contain actives like retinol.) 

The longer I use this product, the better results I see. The first couple of days I used it, I thought it was just an ordinary toner in a strange gel form, but now it‚Äôs my favorite step of my routine. Not only does the toner itself seem quite effective at soothing, firming, and hydrating, but moreover, I think it‚Äôs acting as a booster to make the products that I subsequently apply more effective. I swear my skin gets bouncier and more Gym Mat-esque each day. 

*Who might benefit from using this product:*

I believe anyone would benefit, unless you have an allergy or sensitivity to any of the ingredients, in which case, please stay far away. L‚ÄôHerboflore‚Äôs Facebook page implies that it‚Äôs suited to all seasons and all skin types (of course they want to sell product, so why not say that?). I think the people who would see the most results are probably people who are in need of some serious hydration (dehydrated and/or dry skin types) and people who are concerned about anti-aging. I have sensitive combination skin, and it doesn‚Äôt make my T-zone oily, and my usually dry and sensitive cheeks aren‚Äôt dry and are less sensitive. Some of the ingredients are supposed to be helpful for reducing inflammation and acne, so it might also be a useful product to someone who is acne-prone. I‚Äôm not sure how someone with oily skin would react to this product, especially during hot and humid weather. As I said, it doesn‚Äôt make my T-zone oilier, but I think I‚Äôm less oily than many, and I know some people prefer to use a toner that helps to control oil. Moreover, the weather hasn‚Äôt been that hot since I‚Äôve starting using the toner. 

*How does it stack up to other toners?*

For comparison, the three hydrating toners I‚Äôve used in the past year are the above-mentioned Whamisa toner, the Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner (original version before the upgrade), and the Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner. The Whamisa is too rich for my skin, especially in summer, and as I discussed previously, it doesn‚Äôt give my skin that Gym Mat feel that the Aqua Toner does. I find the Klairs toner very soothing, but nowhere near as hydrating as the L‚ÄôHerboflore. As for the Acwell toner, I like using it to wipe off residue from Vitamin C or other actives, and the L‚ÄôHerboflore definitely doesn‚Äôt have that ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù aspect. The Acwell didn‚Äôt soothe my skin as much as the Klairs toner, and it wasn‚Äôt as hydrating for me as either of the other two. (I‚Äôll probably repurchase the Acwell however to have on hand for post-actives cleansing.) 

*Where to get this product, and how much will it cost you?*

As I mentioned, I purchased my bottle from the U.S. retailer [Beautibi](https://www.beautibi.com/collections/lherboflore/products/lherboflore-aqua-plus-moisturizing-toner), where it costs US $48. Beautibi does ship internationally. (And to reiterate, I am not shilling for this site. I love the curation, but I gain nothing by you shopping there. In fact, if you do buy the toner there, that‚Äôs one less bottle for me to buy.   )  I have not found any other North American retailer that sells this product. 

If you live in Taiwan, China, Malaysia, or Singapore (I believe Singapore has a physical L‚ÄôHerboflore stand, but maybe it‚Äôs only online ordering), you can visit a L‚ÄôHerboflore stand in person or probably order online (for example, in China, you can order L‚ÄôHerboflore off of Taobao‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure if Taobao ships internationally). According to the official L‚ÄôHerboflore site, the toner retails for NTD $1500, which is about US $45 (so you can see that the Beautibi markup is not that big). I included the Chinese name of the product above in case you want to do an Internet search, which might turn up more possible places where you can purchase it. 

*My rating:*

**Five out of five buckets of snail slime and bee spit**, in spite of the fact that Cosdna thinks it might kill me, and in spite of the fact that it‚Äôs the priciest toner I‚Äôve ever purchased. I‚Äôm apprehensive to give a product such a high rating, since skin care varies so much by person, but this product continues to impress me each day. Maybe I‚Äôm having such good results because my hive outbreak left my face dry, flaky, and in such bad shape that things could only get better, but that makes the product even more impressive to me, since when I started using this product the second time around, my skin was still hypersensitive. I‚Äôll definitely repurchase, though I have the ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù Klairs toner in my closet that I‚Äôll need to try first. 

I‚Äôll be reviewing three other L‚ÄôHerboflore skin care products in the coming week (two others from the Aqua line, one from the Flora line), so we‚Äôll see if the rest stack up. So far, I am very excited about the brand and about T-Beauty, and I regret that I didn't buy one of everything that L‚ÄôHerboflore sells when I had the chance in person. 

*Final disclaimer:*

It concerns me that someone could read this and drop almost $50 on a product that potentially doesn‚Äôt work for him/her, so if you choose to purchase this toner, please do so at your own risk. Remember that what gives one person a Gym Mat Face could give another person a dermatological nightmare.

Zesparia,"Help me figure out what I did? - Hi all! So, not a crisis or anything, my face is in fact better than ever, and THAT is how I fucked up. Last weekend I bought two new products - I found a ten-piece box of Leaders Pore-Scaling Black Aqua masks, and a deluxe sample of Hada Labo skin plumping gel cream (on sale and there's a three dollar off manufacturer's coupon for a hada labo product inside the box, if you see any of these get one!). I already use a sheet mask a day as part of my routine and at this point have not found anything I've had issues with ingredient wise so I promptly started used them four days in a row, starting on Sunday night, and patch testing the new moisturizer at the same time.

The SB on my nose are almost completely gone. It's insane, I cannot believe it, I'm actively shocked. Size is vastly reduced and texture is much smoother, I have to actually look for them now! But I do not know what caused this to happen, the moisturizer or the sheet masks. I've never had such amazing results from just sheet masks, even though I know it is intended to help pores. I've not used many products with hyaluronic acid either is the thing, and the other times I've sampled products with it it's brought stuff under my skin to a head, which I can't really find much info on. It's not caused me to break out, just brought up stuff under the surface and leaves my skin smoother.

For now I've stopped using the leaders masks and am using the moisturizer on my nose plus other parts of my face, I'm sticking to other sheet masks to see if that changes things. The sebaceous filaments have not come back which they usually do in a day or two when extracted. Has anyone had experiences with either of these products that could explain this? 

**TL;DR: Which product actually helped me? The moisturizer or the sheet masks?**

I've read this subreddit quite often but this is my first time posting here! I have *super* sensitive skin, plus allergies to **nickel + salicylic acid**, which initially led me to Korean skincare and makeup (most Western makeup has ""minerals"" i.e. nickel and BHAs built into so many skincare products). Ever since I visited Korea and started modifying my routine, I've been swapping out products trying to find what works to help alleviate **redness and occasional acne** on my **combo/sensitive skin**.

My current routine: (usually throw a sheet mask in there and occasionally a clay/bubble foam mask)

1. The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Light Oil
2. Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser
3. Etude House Wonder Pore Freshener
4. Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
5. Mizon Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule
6. Etude House Moistfull Collagen Firming Eye Cream
7. Pond's Dry Skin Cream

Do you have any recommendations for **toners** that might work well or all-over **face creams** I can use that are not as oily as Pond's?

FrauleinD,"Help finding essence and serum (and what I have tried that my skin seems to hate from every step) Suggestions very VERY welcome! - Hello all you beautiful people!

As the title says, I need a bit of help. I used to have a full routine, but since I was an idiot and decided to jump around regarding trying new skincare products, I have just become lost on what used to work for me before. Also, the night serum I used, the Tosowoong Time Shift serum, seems to have been discontinued (each time I tried to buy it this time, the seller refunded my money.) I have gotten out of the denial phase and am now looking for a new one.

I will post my current routine below:

Daytime:

Cleanser: Tosowoong enzyme powder wash (if this ever gets discontined I will just flip out, it's my HG foaming cleanser for my fickle skin)

First Essence: Tosowoong Time Shift First Essnece (Since serum in this line is being discontinued, it seems I may need to find a replacment. Any suggestions that have licorice?)

Toner: Klair's Supple Preparation Toner (again, HG. Will flip if discontinued.)

Essence: none, used to have one, but I flip flopped so much with this step that I have just forgotten what essence product my skin tolerates. Have tried many different ones that have had...not-so-good results.

Serum: Skin &amp; Lab Dr. Color Effect Red serum (I tried this during my nighttime routine since it works during the day, but for some reason if I use it at night, my face breaks out. Does this mean that I shouldn't use this at all even if it works fine at daytime?)

Emulsion: Tosowoong Time Shift Emulsion (since the serum for this line is impossible to find now, I might need to replace this too, any suggestions?)

Eye cream: Purebess 80 galactomyces eye cream

Cream: Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream

Sunscreen: Mainly Biore Bright milk (pink bottle) but will also use the Perfect version (blue bottle). I also have the Biore Waterly Essence and Gel sunscreens, but those just never sink into my skin and leave this greasy film on top (this surprises me, since I have dry skin that flakes in the winter.) So I just leave the last two sunscreens for when I don't need to leave my house and can just have my hair pinned up away from my face.

Nighttime routine:

Oil Cleanser: Klair's Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil

Cleanser: Same as daytime routine

First Essence: Same as daytime routine

Toner: Same as daytime routine

Essence: None at the moment

Serum: None since the one I was using is empty and I can't find it anywhere anymore :(

Eye cream: Same as daytime routine

Cream: Same as daytime routine

Sleeping Pack: I have the Sulhwasoo Overnight Revitalizing mask, although it seems to break me out :( Fuck.

Extras: Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid 4-5 times a week, Cosrx AHA Whitehead power liquid 1-2 times a week, Skin &amp; Lab Glacial Clay mask 2-3 times a week, random sheet masks 3-4 times a week (although lately I have just been too tired to use any, since I mainly use them at night on weekdays. The problem is I will fall asleep if I lay down for too long when I am tired, and I don't want to risk the mask leeching the hydration from my skin like I have heard happening to other people.), OST Vitamin C serum 3-4 times a week.

The things that I have tried that my skin hates:

Essences: 

Benton snail bee high content essence (I used this before and my skin loved it, but after I tried it again after using another essence a while back, my skin broke out from this and was shit for at least 3 months after only using it twice. When this happened, I had changed nothing else in my routine, even after I stopped using the Benton.)

Skin type: Dry, especially on the chin and around my nose

Skin concerns: Hydration/moisturisation, whitening (I am already pale, but would like to keep my skintone even), and acne (I already take BC pills to help this, but still get some break outs nearing the beginning and at the end of my menstrual cycle. Sorry, I know that might be a bit TMI.)

i-likefrenchfries,"Water-based BB Cream? Or something light coverage to even out skin? - Hi all! I'm pretty new to the world of Asian Beauty (and face makeup in general), hence my possibly noob-ish question.

I'm looking for something that is light coverage to even out my skin tone/color. After researching a bit, it seems like BB cream would be my best bet. However, because of my dehydrated combo skin, I'm looking for something water based.

I found Dr. Jart's Hydro Fuse Beauty Balm (~$26 USD) but was hoping to spend about $10-15. Skygirl's and Maybelline's gel BB creams seem pretty popular but they don't seem to be available online.

Do you have any suggestions? Maybe even something that is not necessarily a BB cream but might work for me? Also, I do wear concealer under my eyes and sometimes I think it looks a bit funky without something else to just even it out with the rest of my face if that makes sense??

Edit: Thank you everyone for your suggestions! I looked into all of them, and unfortunately I think Asian face makeup might be a tad too light for my skin tone.

So these were all finished at the end of 2015 and I just have been hoarding these bottles until I had too much clutter. 

Items:
Freeplus Ultra Moist Care Cream - This was cream that my fiance picked up for me when he was working in Japan. I LOVED it. It was simultaneously rich, yet super luxuriously silky and hydrating. I'm not sure what was in in since I didn't get a lot of the packaging (was thrown out to save space in luggage), but it had something that made the skin a little shimmery. 

Dr. MJ Real Mucin Restore Cream - First snail product ever! I have no idea if other sail creams are the same but this was sticky to the max. It definitely spead up any healing that I may have needed from acne and comedones, but it was the stickiest thing that i have ever used. Legitimately, if you stuck a finger in it, it would string over a foot.  It was a good experience as a snail product, but I don't think I would try it again. 

Unni Recepie Vitamin C Essense - Shelf Stable Vit C Essence. It had a very light citrus hint and was a gel liquid. Sunk in really quickly, but it did not seem to do much except provide a slight layer of hydration and some very mild brightening.

innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Toner - This item gave me the worst CCs. I normally don't react to the majority of products but I'm convinced that the ""ash"" the had clogged up my pores. Also heavily fragrance. This would up going on my body post-shower instead.   

Fresh Black Tea Age-defying eye cream - A so-so product. No visible results. This cream is thick and very dense and I was not a fan of how it seemed to just sit on top of my skin. 

unknown brand cleansing oil - this was an item that I randomly purchased in a pharmacy on day. I actually really liked it. It had a very mild floral scent and the consistency is a little bit thicker then the Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil.",1932,366,asian_beauty

I have used this mask several times since my purchase on March so I know how it works and everything.It is supposed to be a run of the mill clay mask,nothing extra special about it.

So as I have it on I hear these little pop pop noises and I'm like ""Hah,did my clay mask just magically turn into a bubbling clay mask?"" and what do you know.
I see my face in the mirror and some parts did bubble/fluff up and they weren't 100% dry either,I touched them and those parts flattened down like how it would if you used for example, the Elizavecca clay mask.

I washed my face and everything and my skin is so far so good,no weird reactions.

Although I'm fortunate to have the luxury of buying in store, I usually buy online because the prices are drastically cheaper (for example, the Skinfood Black Sugar mask is about $15 when I checked the now-out-of-business Skinfood in Northridge, but I can buy it on Amazon for less than $9). I'm wondering if I'm looking in the wrong places.

My first question is: **Do you prefer to buy in store or online, and why and where?
Additionally, do you find certain stores, with the exception of Amore/Aritaum, offering products cheaper or similar in price to those online?**

I'm specifically looking to buy 2 items in person- the Biore Watery Essence sunscreen and The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Light Oil.

**Where can I find the Biore Watery Essence sunscreen, preferably under $10?**
I'm hoping for someplace closer to San Fernando (I go to San Gabriel, but it's a bit far), even if that means Little Tokyo. I just haven't seen it in store ever since I've known about the product. Can it be found in markets like Galleria or Greenland?

**Is it cheaper to buy the Light Oil online or in an actual The Face Shop?**

redrose280,"Gel or liquid textures of toners and first essences: which do you prefer? - I was responding to a question last night regarding first essences when I was reminded of an observation, and I believe a complaint for some, about the texture of the CosRX Galactomyces Whitening Essence - namely, that it has more of a gel-like texture than the liquidy, watery texture that a lot of us expect from first essences. And as a long-time user and fan of the Hada Labo Gokuyun Super Hyaluronic Acid Lotion Moist (described by Skin and Tonics [here](http://skinandtonics.com/rohto-hada-labo-gokujyn-super-hyaluronic-acid-lotion-review/), I've been awfully tempted by the newer Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion, with a lot more hyaluronic acid action, but with a thicker, gel-like texture (described by Fiddy on her blog [here](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2016/03/26/hail-hydra-hada-labo-gokujyun-premium-lotion-review-hada-labo-lotion-tips/)), that fits more along the lines of a serum texture than the liquidy, watery texture we might expect from a toner.


Having used the CosRX Galactomyces essence, I never found the thicker texture to interfere with applying the subsequent steps of my routine, and I've been wondering if it's possible to use the Hada Labo Premium lotion in the toner step and successfully layer my subsequent steps on top of it, instead of using it later in my routine (these are just random thoughts of mine, not asking for a specific recommendation, but definitely chime in if you have experience! :)) What are your thoughts and preferences on texture for first essences and toners? Do you find that thicker, gel-like textures of FTEs and toners interfere with the absorption of your subsequent steps? Do you find that thicker textures actually enhance absorption of subsequent steps? Are the textures of certain first essences and/or toners a deal-breaker for you?

pastelfluff,"""Homebang"" Pack - Just awhile back, /u/teamprettybitch posted a link that led to a Korean Youtuber, U:Na's channel. After watching her ""homebang"" video, I decided to try it out!


I purchased the powders off GMarket Korea (I went a little heavy handed and bought Seaweed, Job's Tears, Licorice, Mung Bean, Red Bean, Rice Bran, Oatmeal). I just tried the Mung Bean pack. Added a little water to it (ratio of 1:1), mixed well and used a clean flat foundation brush to apply it onto my face. I left it on for about 10 minutes until it dried up on my face. I washed it off with warm water (try to use warm water because it's pretty hard to wash off with cold water). Because the powder's not finely grounded, it provided a little bit of an exfoliating effect which could hurt if you rub it too hard against your skin. If you have sensitive skin maybe you can ground the powder again!


I'll let you guys know if it works!


**My skincare routine** (currently, because I made the mistake of not patch testing the Innisfree sunblock and it clogged up my pores so bad and broke me out a little. I usually don't patch test because I have never gotten any problems with any products. Big mistake. And *oh crap* I forgot to patch test the Mung Bean pack too. I shall make sure I do it for the rest.)**:**

After it dried, I peeled off the sheet and noticed that the ""paper"" was uncharacteristically fuzzy and falling apart.  I smelled the dried part of the paper and UGH it smelled like musty mildew.  Kind of like wet rotten cardboard that's been left in flood damage, or wet old books (and not in a good way).  A little bit like morning breath when you have a cold.  It smelled **bad**.

I definitely smelled it beforehand since it was my first Rose Dew mask ever.  While the essence smelled strong, the scent wasn't entirely unpleasant.  I didn't love it, but I chocked it up to me not liking that rose scent.

&amp;nbsp;    
I have struggled with 'iffy' skin since my teenage years. I am 24 now, and FINALLY have my skin somewhat under control (breakout wise). After a horrible hormonal cystic acne breakout a couple of years ago, I switched birth controls and saw a dermatologist who got me on prescriptions suited to my skin. I use Aczone in the morning and tretinoin 0.08% (micro gel) at night - I was on 0.04% consistently for about 8 moths up until summer of last year when I ran out and didn't repurchase because of how expensive it was with my new insurance. Currently using 0.08% and have been since November, though not as consistently as I should be. Still get the 'tret skin', but overall I really don't get any new breakouts unless it's around my period.  
&amp;nbsp;    
I purchased a few basic starter items to slowly convert to all AB. I have been using **Shiseido Senka Aging Care UV Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++**, **Hada Labo Rohto Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion**, and **Konjac Sponges** for about a year and I'm happy with those! Started using the lotion when I started tret the first time, and it really helped. Konjac sponges are AMAZING and I don't think I will ever stray away from those since they help so much with peeling and overall texture.     
&amp;nbsp;    
*Here are the products I have recently purchased/currently have and plan on incorporating into my routine*    &amp;nbsp;    
* **KOSE COSMEPORT softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil** - (Stupid me bought a baggy refill instead of the pump bottle trying to find an Amazon seller that offered prime shipping in order to get it faster. Any suggestions on what I can put this in so I can use it up?)  
* **Rosette Aqua Ceramide Gel** - This probably won't be here for atleast 3 weeks :(  
* **Mizon Black Snail AIO**  
* **[MIZON] AHA 8% Peeling Serum** - Not going to start using this till I get some of my dehydration/skin barrier back in order and have completely gotten used to the higher strength tret.  
* **MBD Apple Sheet Mask**    
* **MBD Black Pearl Sheet Mask**  
* **Shark Sauce** - I ordered this but don't have it yet, hoping it ships soon!  
* Not AB, but I'm using **Himalaya Neem &amp; Tumeric Face Wash** for my 2nd cleanser (it's gel-like and really light) until I run out. I plan on purchasing Hada Labo foam cleanser next.  
* **Leven Rose Organic Rosehip Oil**   
* Not AB, but I also have and love **Avene Thermal Spring Water**           
&amp;nbsp;    
Can anyone give me a lowdown of what my routine should look like? Again, I use Aczone in the AM and tret at night. Currently only using it every other night-ish. I slacked off when I was waiting for my last tube of sunscreen to come in for about 3 weeks, so in the past week i've been really starting to incorporate it again so I can get the full benefits of it. I have the charcoal, green tea, and pink clay Konjac Sponges, which I alternate in the morning with water only to ""wash"" my face. Currently using Cerave PM as a moisturizer day and night, but I'm trying to replace this. It's a good moisturizer but I don't think it agrees with me fully.    
&amp;nbsp;    
So this is where I'm hoping you guys can give me suggestions on my routine order, new products and techniques that may benefit me. Trying to stay as basic as possible and not have a SUPER long routine. The progress I've seen from stalking you guys has been amazing! I have come a long way since that horrible breakout years ago, but I just want my skin to glow again!    
&amp;nbsp;    
I have **Combination/Oily/Dehydrated** skin with scars, PIE/PIH (I'm medium/deep/caramel toned - not sure if that limits me from any whitening products or certain ingredients), pores that are out of this world, SFs on my chin and nose pretty crucial and redness/dullness in general that I'm trying to combat without bringing on any new breakouts. My scarring is mainly icepick scars on my cheeks &amp; some from teenage breakouts on my forehead. I got one session of micro needling (Eclipse Micropen) done back in November, but stopped due to $$$. I did see slight benefits just from that one time though. I'm going to try to upload a close up later so you guys can get a better idea of what I'm really working with.    
&amp;nbsp;    
A lot of the products I use/will be using have niacinamide in them, so I'm trying to hold off on Vitamin C till I incorporate another daytime moisturizer that doesn't have it. I would like to add something to help soothe my skin in the event of a breakout (perhaps the cosrx rice mask?? I've heard a lot of good things about it). Looking for a lighter moisturizer that will work with my skin type, and hoping to find something a little heavier that I can use at nighttime to help with the dehydration. Not sure if the Rosette Gel I just ordered will suffice. I seal with Vaseline at night if I'm feeling super irritated. I'm just so confused on what type of product is used for what stage, etc. and I tend to second guess my self which leads to me getting discouraged and giving up.    
&amp;nbsp;

-joie-de-vivre-,"newbie struggling to understand what skin is trying say, help appreciated! - ‚Äãmy initial post was extremely long winded so I hope you guys don't mind the brevity:

* skin is dry, red and flaky 
* oily, SF covered nose, cheek and forehead areas (very pimple prone too).

* PIH and whiteheads (I think) under nose and skin under lip
* trying to figure out whether I have dry skin that is dehydrated, hence excess oil production, or combo skin that is both dry and oily (and probably dehydrated).
* looking for new suitable cleanser (and moisturizer) as my first step to a AB routine

(I get that there is no such unicorn tear filled cleanser that will help with all of above but would appreciate something that won't trigger)

* cleansers attempted: cetaphil (gentle skin, oil control), cerave (foaming, hydrating), aveeno (clear complexion) and bioderma (sebium, atoderm)
* previous routine: cleanser (from above), wash off, moisturize (cetaphil in jar)
* recently moved to SE Asia
* eczema prone (not face, but legs, ankles)
* was trying to decide between DHC Oil Cleanser, Kose Speedy and Banila Zero when this other girl came up to me and said my skin was super sensitive and that I should try this micellar water instead of trying OCM and stripping away my very little amounts of oil on my very dry skin (very confused, I thought trying OCM would be less harsh on skin than SLS found in bioderma cleansers currently used, but what do I know)

any thoughts/suggestions/comments would be much appreciated!!!

She then tells me that I cant take pictures of any of the products in the store. I'm fine with this, since I see signs saying ""no pictures""  at the places in Hmart. So I continue to do research to see if this charcoal mask was legit, then suddenly the clerk starts making condescending remarks about me doing research.

heyhellohio,"Applying OST C20 causing fingers to peel? - I recently got my bottle of OST C20 from Wishtrend, and am currently patchtesting it. I realised that my index finger was peeling today, but didn't link it to the C20. I thought it was strange, because my fingers aren't prone to peeling at all- plus I didn't have any reaction to the C20 aside from a stinging feeling, which I understand is normal. 


Then I applied my C20 today, and I realised that right after I rinsed my hands with soap, the finger that I used to apply the C20 was peeling! It's just a minor peel, but I suspect it might worsen because the peeling on my index finger looks quite bad. About a centimetre of peeled off skin. 


I know some minor peeling shouldn't be of much worry, but if the peeling will continue, I might switch to using cotton pads to protect my fingers. I'm just curious whether this has occurred to anybody else? And if so, (sorry if this is a stupid question) is it because the vitamin C is just exfoliating your skin? Or is this predictive of a reaction to the product? Or..?

extracelestial_,"gentle chemical exfoliator (or something to help with dry patches)? - AB has helped a ton with weaning me off steroid cream for my eczema, but I have a few persistent dry/eczema patches that don't seem to calm down no matter what I do. The patches usually feel rough and look like there's a little build up of dead skin (and lately they've been darker patches than the rest of my skin -_-). Any tips for someone with dry and sensitive skin?

I am trying to slowly incorporate some AB products into a skincare routine, as I am very unhappy with my skin. It is combination skin: extremely oily in my T-zone and dry on my cheeks, but with dry patches in my T-zone also. I also have sebaceous filaments and redness.

There is so much information on this sub about different products - what would you describe as your ""staple""/""must-have"" products, and why? I have never used a lot of things such as oil/foaming cleansers, so I don't want to start with anything too harsh, just something simple but effective.

So I *finally* convinced my boyfriend that a skincare routine would be a good idea.

He is blessed with nearly acne-free skin, but the texture is a bit rough and dirty-looking. I wanted to make a very simple, generic routine for him, with as few steps as possible.

Cosrx Good Morning Low-pH cleanser

Some sort of extremely gentle active (?)

Moisturizer (currently thinking Rosette Ceramide gel)

Sunscreen (this is currently the only step he does)

Their excuse is that the Coxrx box wasn't in stock but I PERSONALLY checked a week ago and it definitely was until the weekend.

NerdTurtle,"Innisfree Water Glow Cushion #13 Swatch w/ Western Foundations! First contributing post! - http://imgur.com/gallery/D41sA

Yay first contributing post! It was difficult to find a neutrally bb cream or cushion so I just guessed with the Innisfree. It's much more neutral than Siberia (holy yellow batman!) but not as pink as NW10. I actually really like the color. People said it was yellow leaning, but I think it's really more beige than yellow or pink. The reasons I don't like it are it tends to cake up really fast and it's more coverage than I'm looking for. I have normal-dry skin but using the puff caused caking almost instantly. Using my Beauty Blender damp helped a bit but it still seemed to sit on my skin. After a few hours (all day) my skin must have produced enough oil because it looked better right before I cleansed.

I have swatched my Innisfree Water Glow Cushion in #13 against some of the Western foundation samples I have on hand. The Innisfree is down the side. Also included are: MAC SFF in NW10, Cover FX Custom Cover drops in N10, NARS Sheer Glow in Siberia, and MUFE Ultra HD in Y205.",1113,198,asian_beauty

myobiyuki,"Eye Lash Glue Recommendations? - I was hoping someone could give me recommendations on a really good lash glue brand? Hoping for something with a brush applicator. I've heard good things about Dolly Wink and D.U.P. but I'm hoping for more input.

Glues I've tried:

**Duo** - a looong time ago, don't really remember much about it but it was tube format and messy.. 

**Daiso (black, tube)** - What I currently use. It's decent and easier to remove than the rest as the glue dries rubbery and you can just peel it off. It's in tube form so it's messy... has spilled on some of my clothes and makeup bag before and that was a pain.

**Daiso (clear mini bottle with applicator wand)** - dries clear and hard but kind of felt like burning at the beginning which goes away when dried but still a concerning symptom. The hardness when dried really helps eyelashes not droop. Other than that, I really don't like this lash glue.

**Darkness** - I used it as a double eyelid glue and it's strong and lasts longer than other eyelid glues (koji, etc.) that I've tried. Problem with this one is that though it's intended use is for lashes, it doesn't feel like it dries stiff enough to keep lashes from drooping. Also, when used as an eyelid glue, it was kind of a pain to remove. Kind of reminds me of when you're trying to remove an annoying sticker and it peels off leaving residue.

* Product details
* What is a micellar/cleansing water?
* Ingredients
* Packaging
* Demonstration
* Final thoughts &amp; why I like it

/u/SophieBulsara and /u/sarcasticmethod mentioned that the value of daily routine posts ([I post mine on IG](https://www.instagram.com/snowwhiteandtheasianpear/)) is to show what reviewers actually use day after day.  This cleansing water has been featured really heavily in my IG routines and it was overdue to be reviewed.  A few days after I posted a review, a similar topic popped up on AB so I'm glad to know I'm not alone in my aversion to cold mornings + water!

A year or so ago, someone PSA'd this on AB, and ever since then, I've been in love with the Sulwhasoo 2004 Shine Pact, and have always been keeping an eye out for it but $69 was too pricey for something that was largely ornamental (I'm still chasing down a refill for it, so I can use it) but I just couldn't get it out of my mind.  I had saved up my pennies and was going to get a 2015 Shine Pact for my birthday/christmas gift to myself, but when it was released, I hated it.  (No hate if you love it, it just doesn't do it for me.)  Then the unicorn appeared- the one I'd been wanting all along, and now it's mine! ^*gollum ^noises*

MidnightDemon,"New to AB, looking for product recommendations! - So, I'm migrating here after stumbling across you guys mentioned on r/makeupaddiction.  I'm a pale white girl who discovered a few amazing Japanese products years back when I was in university and went there to visit.  Biore foaming exfoliant lit. saved my skin.  First use I noticed a difference.  My blackheads disappeared overnight, my skin cleared up immensely within the length of the trip.  I bought enough to bring back to Canada with me to almost 2 years.  American (physical) exfoliants can be like sandpaper.   
  
I eventually ran out, but could never find the products again.  I've since been stumbling through trying to find a set of products that work.  I am 27 now, I eat (reasonably) well, fit and do gym and yoga 4-5 times a week. Currently my skin regime is as follows:  
  
*DHC Deep Cleansing Oil (let sit 1-5mins) [2x-5x/week]  
*Noxzema Original Deep Cleansing Cream or Get Prepped Facial Cleanser with Jasmine (gel, discontinued)   
*St Ives Exfoliating Pads [4-5% lactic acid]  
*Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 8% AHA Gel Exfoliant  
*Aveda Botanical Kinetic Skin Firming / Toning Agent (For Dry and Combination Skin)  
*Neutrogena Oil‚ÄëFree Facial Moisturizer with Sunscreen SPF 15  
  
-&gt; followed by makeup routine with primer  

I have combination skin, some odd pimples but no blackheads.  Very oil T-zone, dryish cheeks (been improving) ... but ... within the last year or so I've been getting these bumps under my skin that won't go away.  At first I thought they were large pimples but they never came out.  They're not red, they just feel like a mole and you can see them a bit under makeup.  I stick them with a needle every few weeks and that makes them go down.  I have really bad wrinkles on my forehead I want to minimize, freckles on my nose I'd like to lighten, big pores on my nose (hopefully the AHA will kill the SFs and help with that) and brittle nails.  I'm taking vitamin D and biotin.

justaprimer,"Newbie Questions about Acne-Fighting Masks + Sheet Masks + pH of Cleansers - Hi! I'm new here, and I've just started delving into the world of AB. I'd love to get answers to a few questions:

- Are there any masks you know of that are good for fighting acne? 

- Can sheet masks do anything other than hydrate?

- Is it important to use a low pH cleanser if you don‚Äôt use any actives? I don't think I've ever used a low-pH cleanser before (at least not knowingly).

- What exactly is the Innisfree ‚ÄúSkin‚Äù? Is it a toner? An essence?

Notes about my skin type: I‚Äôm in my early 20s. I would classify my skin type as pretty normal, although my forehead can get mildly oily and my cheeks can get mildly dry (but my skin is more frequently dehydrated than truly dry). I‚Äôve never had my face break out in response to a product, but I would still classify it as somewhat sensitive. I don‚Äôt have huge acne problems, but whiteheads &amp; closed comedones/cysts (not exactly sure what to call them) are the bane of my skincare existence. Both of these mostly pop up on my forehead and chin. The cysts are the WORST ‚Äì painful lumps that I can feel existing under my skin but can‚Äôt seem to do anything about and will usually last for a week or two before going away.

2catsinjapan,"Question to those who had cosmetic procedures done in Korea - I've been reading reviews and opinions (both good and bad) all week and I'm still not sure how to select a reputable clinic.
I don't speak Korean so I'm kind of limited to finding an English or Japanese speaking clinic. Though I'd prefer English for obvious reasons.

The procedure I'm interested in is very minor but very few places in Japan do it, and I'm hoping I'll have better luck in Korea.
I want to get hyaluronic acid undereye fillers.
I see that in the US it's a popular option but not so much in Japan.

Of course it's cheaper for me to go to Korea to get it done than to the US or Canada.

I'm just worried that in Korea it will be as unpopular as in Japan (Asian face structure is different and at least in Japan I was told that few women require such a procedure).

So I guess I'd need a big, reputable clinic specializing in face, specifically in the eye area.

Any and all suggestions, ideas and comments are welcome.

catella18,"Not understanding face - So, I've been at it for about two years. Mostly AB, the last year has ben 100% AB. I've gotten to the point where I understand that if I don't get enough moisturizer or I over exfoliate (which for my skin is apparently 2-3 times a week) I get deep red spots. However, I can never seem to get enough moisturizer in to make my face happy. The two times I was close to feeling like I had hydrated skin were both when I tried an oil (maracuja, and now the Goodall oil) and I'm fairly certain the Goodal Waterest Lasting Oil is now breaking me out just like the Maracuja. Before I tried the Waterest Lasting Oil, my face broke out because my normal routine wasn't strong enough to withstand four flights (dry airplane air) and a weekend of wedding drinking. Hence, trying an oil for the second time. 

I'm doing Adapalene only once a week, which doesn't really seem to be unclogging more pores but anything more seems to make a different kind of breakout happen. I facemask almost daily, use MRCS for my wash, layer with Hada Labo lotion and Holy Snails' Shark Sauce and seal it all in with Freeset Donkey Cream. None of this makes my skin clear, normally just gets to basic clogs. And if any dry factors come in at all, I'm set over the edge and my face does a 180. So it's not enough, and anything else either exfoliating-wise or deep moisture-wise is too much. How the heck do I win this damn game!?

adventuresofthemurr,"AB substitute for Sephora eye mask? - So I recently tried the Sephora pearl eye mask and I was wondering if there are any AB masks like it? On the package it says ""Evens out eye contour skin and helps minimize irregularities"" ""illuminates the skin for more beautiful eyes"" and ""for a look that is uniform,fresh and radiant."" 

I'm looking for an AB replacement because they're much more convient to get a hold of than driving 3-4 towns over to the nearest sephoras, or paying more money than what I pay for the mask itself on shipping.",536,97,asian_beauty

strudelcheeks,"Your travel routine, carry-on only - Currently on a business trip and didn't have a ton of time to pack, so threw whatever seemed smallish sized into my bag. Not very intentional, and I ended up with: 

* Hada Labo UV White Gel (just &gt;3 oz, was so nervous TSA would take my precious, but was fine)

* Muji Sensitive Essence (travel sz)

* Acure Sensitive Cream

* Rose hip oil

* no cleanser except for a stray cetaphil wipe! :O


Looks like a lot of short plane trips with just a carryon in my near future and I'd like to be smarter and better prepared. 

How do you keep up a good routine on the road? What are your essentials?

The obvious answer is to buck up and get some empty travel sized jars etc, but curious if anyone has different or complementary tricks.

pizzapunch123,"Papa Recipe AHA: some mini thoughts! - Papa Recipe (and this AHA) is marketed and supposedly formulated for people with dry, sensitive skin. However, I have combo-oily skin and I have been having really fantastic results with this product: Papa Recipe White Flower Clear Up 8% AHA Gel. :) I haven't heard much about this product on this subreddit, so I thought I would give it some love!

I've tried the Mizon and Paula's Choice 10% AHA's as well.
If I had to rank them in terms of results for my skin (of course, YMMV), it would probably go like this:

1. Papa Recipe

2. Mizon (and man did I love the Mizon, so this is quite a surprise for me!)

3. PC

The biggest plus of the Papa Recipe so far, in my opinion, is that it has lactic acid as its sixth ingredient, and niacinamide as its seventh. More than the other two AHA's, the Papa Recipe has really ""brightened"" my skin tone. Ever since I started using the PR, every time I look at a mirror, I'm consistently surprised at how even my skin tone is.

This in combo with the Shara Shara Honey AIO (which also has niacinamide as the 4th ingredient) have been giving my skin some serious luster, hehehe. As someone whose main problems right now are closed comedones (caused by hyaluronic acid, I've realized, sigh... goodbye Biore Watery Gel) and PIH, I'm feeling properly lucky that I'm finally finding some really solid stuff that works for my skin! All hail niacinamide!

So, here's to some love for a product that could probably do with some more loving! ;)

Edit: Another thing that I am not particularly sure of (and which someone more informed in Chemistry would be far better equipped to discuss) is how niacinamide is playing within this formulation. I don't know much about how niacinamide plays with acids and at a low pH. I can only say that I've been having positive results with this product, but I think that that's something I would have to look more into.

Sunday PM: I did another sheet mask I think Naisture caviar? And then skin watchers green snail hydrating gel, Innisfree aloe revital sleeping pack, Cerave moisturizing cream

Monday: cleansed with Cerave hydrating cleanser, red wine Naisture mask, Mizon repair ampoule, Paula's choice skin perfecting 2% BHA gel, Cerave AM, Cerave moisturizer.

Monday PM: MBD cactus mask and reviva labs rosewater facial spray, skin watchers green snail hydrating gel, Cerave moisturizing cream, end capped with coconut oil because it's arid af in California right now.

I'm completely new to AB. I've only ever used a South Korean BB Cream by Missha which I liked. Apart from that, I haven't used any asian skin care products.

I'm traveling to Tokyo in a month and I was wondering what products I should look into/eventually purchase?

Now to my skin:

I'm 21 years old. I have combination skin. It's naturally very oily, especially in the T-Zone, but it can get really dry especially in the winter or when I use certain products.
2 months ago I stopped taking the contraceptive pill - it's the only thing that really ever helped my skin in terms of ""acne"".

 Now that I've stopped taking it, my skin is back to its roots and I get spots all the time (mostly between my eyebrows/on my nose, but occasionally on the forehead, the chin, now even the cheeks.. basically everywhere. I also have some pimples now on my cleavage, back, and neck). 

I got into INCI's a while ago. I use mostly German brand stuff and I always look for products with nice ingredients that don't cause irritation. For my acne, I'm currently using 2% BHA gel, and a cleanser containing Kaolin, AHA and BHA. 
It works, but it really dries out my skin...

Does anyone else have this problem? It seems in some cases the products work great for me for a few weeks then poof kill my skin.

I'm not entirely sure how to proceed at this point. Have been keeping a spreadsheet of everything I use and when I use it and listing reactions.

Example: Dynasty Cream. Sounded great on paper, got glowing reviews blah blah. Ordered and patch tested: passed. Used nightly.

First week: Great results, skin texture improved and skin plumped

Second week: a few whiteheads show up (nothing else in routine had changed) and redness intensifies slightly after application. attribute whiteheads to possible cycle changes.

Third week: horrible bumps showed up under the redness which is now a deep red color, and blackheads on my nose

Fourth week: itchy dry patches arrived along with the new whiteheads

Fifth week: stopped using Dynasty Cream and the redness is slowly fading. Whiteheads have gone.",1285,220,asian_beauty

pako_poko,"Need Help With Skin ""Bleaching""! - ~ I happened to stumble upon this subreddit while going through /r/SkincareAddiction, and from first impressions, this place seems pretty amazing ~

Hi everyone ~ 

This topic *might* be offensive to some people here, and if you do find it offensive, I do sincerely apologize in advance.

So, I actually came here looking for things related to skin ""whitening"" and searched through this subreddit trying to look for info and guides, only to find out that ""whitening"" is actually making the skin look even and brighter (now I feel like a fool :3 ). What I'm actually trying to achieve is more like skin ""bleaching"", or making my skin color lighter/paler (the reason? I'm Asian... like born in and gonna die in Asia... so yeah). When I was younger, my skin color was more like white/pale with a yellowish tint (in a sense), but after taking 4 years of swimming classes in an outdoor open-area swimming pool under the stupidly hot sun, my skin color is now like yellow-brown :( . Thus, I want to try to restore my skin color to the original one from before (or at least as close as possible)! 

Before the questions part, here's some useful (or not) info about me that might help prevent a face catastrophe: **a)** My face's skin is super sensitive, acne-prone, and oily (also, it's apparently *unusually* thin as said by my dermatologist) **b)** However, the rest of my body is pretty ok with most skincare products... I think **c)** My face hates Retin-A/Retinol for some reason (whenever I use it it feels like there's a mini-sun on my face) **d)** Lastly, I don't really get burns that much from the sun but I tan super fast, which is a bummer.

Finally! Here are my questions I'd like to ask you all today:

**1)** What methods/processes do I need to do in order to achieve lighter skin color? What types of skincare products assist in skin bleaching? To be honest, I kinda have a gist on it (like to use sunscreen religiously and to use some sort of exfoliator and/or moisturizer), but other than that... I really have no clue in regards to skin bleaching. I was going to try rubbing limes on my face until I've read that that's actually harmful for you.

**2)** In addition to using skincare products, what sort of supplements/pills/foods/etc. can you eat/take in order to aid in skin bleaching? Do glatathione and vitamin C/D/E pills help? (I've seen both conflicting and supporting reports on them so I don't know what to believe in &gt;&lt;)

**3)** Any specific product(s) that, based on personal experience with said product(s), you would recommend trying out? I'm looking for products that are actually effective and ones that won't *outright obliterate your skin*. (Although I do want to make my whole body lighter, I'm focusing more on the face, since that area of my body is quite tanner than the rest...)
 
**4)** Any other general tips/advice in regards to skin bleaching? Any things (e.g. certain products/procedures like those homemade ones on the internet/etc.) to avoid?

I'd really, really appreciate all of your help if you are able to take your generous time in order to answer these questions. Even if you can only help with one of the four questions, I'm really more than grateful for your help.

Hopefully, if this post gets comprehensive enough, other people in the future would be able to use this as a guide to skin bleaching! (At least that's what I'm hoping for)

**EDIT:** Oh yeah I forgot to mention but, even though I want to make my whole body lighter, I want to focus more on the face since it's pretty tanner when compared to the rest of the body. 

**EDIT #2:** I do use sunscreen, both face and body, when I do actually go outside of the house! (Oh and the down votes on this post tho ._. )",3763,663,asian_beauty

ar2289,"LHAs? - So I came across a mention of LHAs, or lipo-hydroxy acids (aka 'capryloyl salicylic acid') today. It's some kind of more gentle/less irritating (even) more lipophilic BHA derivative, but the two things that are most intriguing about it are that it has an effective pH of 5.5, and that it apparently also behaves like a weaker tretinoin. Some links: [1](https://www.futurederm.com/what-is-lha-in-skin-care/) [2](https://www.futurederm.com/differences-glycolic-acid-salicyclic-acid-lipohydroxy-acid-gluconolactone/)

From what I can find, it's used so far only in La Roche Posay, Kiehl's and Skinceuticals‚Äîall L'Oreal group, so don't know if they have a patent on it? Has anyone used products containing this though, especially of the AB variety/what has your experience been? Thanks!

Brands that are on sale now are: MBD, My Scheming, Sexylook and Simply. There are also other sheet masks available too.

The price can go as low as 0.8USD per sheet mask, shipping is not included. 

Is anyone interested?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit: I quickly quote the shipping from the post office and I actually marked up 1/2 USD just in case, hope you don't mind. If you are buying over 40 masks( over 2 kg), I recommend you to use  surface parcel as it is cheaper, the bad thing is: you have to wait at least a month. 


[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F5ZnYQ2QeZOBwxVwTaNQWeHMZ_iNFNgTOVOyYoX2I9Y/edit?usp=sharing) is the price list of shipping and some of the masks


Edit 2 : I came across a great My scheming masks deal! If you are wondering why the masks are so cheap and want to know if it's fake, I went to my scheming official website and check the code of 1/2 boxes already, they are real.


**Edit 3**: If you are okay with shipping, you can put in which type and how many mask you want in the spreadsheet. It's just to let me know how much I need to buy and find the best bulk purchase deal :) 


**EDIT 4**: I will make a post on /r/asianbeautyexchange after I finialise how many people want to order and what kind of masks that we are going to get in bulk ( Mainly my scheming, MBD and Lovemore so far). Please check this post to get updates as I don't want to make multiple posts.

AB is full of economical miracle products, so I thought I'd ask the AB geniuses. - I've researched products for myself, but I feel so out of my depth in the ""anti aging"" market

The creme has a pleasant aroma. It absorbs quickly and it plumps skin.

I think a luxurious creme or the combination of an essance or ampule and night creme combo may be nice for her... maybe even **A** sheet mask.  She's not too keen on extensive routines or self pampering, so I'm not going to buy her a bunch of sheet masks until I know she likes them.

She has freckled skin, and it's somewhat dry. Not very sensitive.  Nearly 60, but she's done well staying out of the sun.

ARITAUM Pore Master Sebum Control Primer - this appkys so nicely! i have big pores ..this seems to help a little but not very noticable, otoh i really like how its you barely feel it on skin and its so easy to apply

Too Cool For School Milk Tint  01 Milky Pink - bottle is a bit strange, have to shove and yank applicator in and out...the pink shows up as a nice bright dark pink color, but my lips are dark. it smells like strawberry milk so yummy

FACE SHOP Face It Artist Touch Lipstick [Moisture] BR802 - much darker than i was expecting...its like a dark rose pink brown color, bc my skin is dark it kind of suits, but that color is not really my style...finding nude lip for nc35ish skin is hard =.= (help anyone?)

LadyFoxBlogger,"Common Habbits That Cause Facial Asymmetry! - Hey Gals! New news for your beauty life!
Sorry i haven't been able to do more infomative post but i think you will like this one!

Facial Asymmetry
----------------------------------------------------
When you look at your mirror have you ever noticed that your left side is more slim than the other? Do you see your face side similar or is it different?
this is one of my biggest concerns facial asymmetry is also important in terms of health for your body. Facial asymmetry can cause spine asymmetry if left without correction.

so what is Facial asymmetry?
----------------------------------------------------
Facial symmetry is one specific measure of bodily asymmetry. Along with traits such as averageness and youthfulness it influences judgements of aesthetic traits of physical attractiveness and beauty. It is also associated with health and genetic fitness.

So bacially do you see your face asymmetry or symmetry?
If you have a just a slight asymmetry everyday habbit change can help but if it's serious i suggest you go see a doctor.

Are you worried that your face is facial asymmetry?
Let's do a test together!

Facial Asymmetry Self Test
----------------------------------------------------
-Is your nose tip, lip bridge, chin in a straight line?
-is your cheek bones on the different location and size?
-when u smile does one side lip goes higher than the other?
-is both side of the chin line different?
-do you hear sound or pain when you chew?
-is center of your upper teeth different from the lower teeth?
-Do you feel your face tilting to one side?

What makes facial asymmetry?
1. chewing food only on one side
2. leaning on one cheek
3. you tilt your head when you look at your smartphones
4. you sleep on your side
5. when you stand you lean on one leg
6. you twist your legs when you sit.

To prevent facial asymmetry
fixing these habbit can help you in the long run. if you have been doing these action lately lets try to change it!

If your are already having facial asymmetry
the best (and expensive) way to fix it is by getting facial pressure massage (I heard it hurts baddly) and care. (these massage is reason why idols face gets smaller every day!)Ôªø",2228,378,asian_beauty

After I apply it, my face looks a bit sticky, shiny, oily because of the layer of cream on it. However, after a while, it soaks in completely, my face is left matte and bright! This is very interesting because all other creams have left my face with a shine or oily look to it ( or glowy maybe), and made my face darker (I have no idea why, maybe it's kind of like how paper turns dark when it's wet and hydrated). Since I wasn't sure if the cream just works really well for me or if it simply wasn't moisturizing enough, I applied another generous layer and then it sunk right in afterwards! I'm not complaining at all since it leaves my face bright and matte, but I find this really strange and wanted to ask if this was normal for a cream, or like some people mentioned, that it is not very a very moisturizing cream.

As winter is slowly approaching Canada, the weather has been getting so dry that I have been breaking out quite a bit.

kuroneko051,"First AB Sunscreen: Brand for Classic Combination (oily T zone, dry U zone), acne prone - Hello all,

Been lurking in this sub for quite a while. So a friend is going to Korea soon. I want to ask his help to buy a sunscreen for me, but not sure about what to buy. Hopefully someone can help giving comparison or recommend a product!

Based on other thread, my option falls on:
- The Face Shop Natural Sun Eco Sebum Control Moisture Sun SPF40 PA+++
- Innisfree Eco Safety Daily Sunblock
- Innisfree Eco No Sebum Sunblock
- Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence

All of these fall under my budget, provided I only need to repurchase them 2x-3x a year.

About me:
- Combination skin (oily T zone, dry U zone). My face are prone to small bumps, and become pimples if I used wrong product/ nearing period.

- Using SCA routine (cleanser at PM, toner, spot treatment at PM then moisturize). Exfoliate once a week with physical scrub, biweekly for clay mask. Using Biotherm Normal/Combination skim line for all of this and Aztec Clay mask. Then Innisfree Real Squeeze mask after exfoliation :3

- The place I leave in has humid weather, so I don't want something greasy. 80% of the time I would only be inside the office and not much going under the sun.

I forgot to take a picture of the instructions, but you're supposed to leave it on for 10 minutes after cleansing, and then wash it off before using toner. 

I've only used it for one night so far, but it felt quite nice on my skin, and my redness seemed a little better this morning. It's the first mask pack I've used, so I don't really have anything to compare it to :( It does have kind of a strong fragrance, similar to honey but rather chemical-ly.

Then I used Cosrx for two months. It dried out my skin, I made sure to moisturize. It exfoliated my skin a bit, some whiteheads came out, Cosrx fixed it. I mean it did the basic thing. But I just miss the smooth texture on my face that I haven't felt for, like, half a year since a major breakout when I tried everything to heal it (but hurt it at the same time).

Anyway, until I got tired of the 100ml bottle that never seems to go away. So like everyone who cannot control one's spending very properly, I ordered Mizon 8% from ebay, it came last Friday.

It's magical!!! I've used it for only 3-4 nights, but it made such a big difference!!! 
1) Skin feels so silky, so smooth to the touch. Yes I still have closed comedones but it's weird, I don't know how to explain it. except for those little bumpy area, the rest of my face is smoothhh.
2) several active whiteheads simply disappear or become less painful. I looked into the mirror this afternoon and felt something missing. Where is that whitehead on the chin??? It simply disappears, really.
3) It doesn't feel as drying. 

The only downside is it's a bottle of 40ml. I'm worried that it would run out soon. As soon as november hits I'll probably purchase 2-3 more just in case...

GlitterDot,"The AB routine that rescued my damaged skin FAST! - So here's the situation. Last week I had major surgery and spent 4 days in the hospital. I brought a few decants of some clarifying products because my last hospitalization brought on a major breakout and I was expecting an encore. What I wasn't expecting was that the strongest painkillers they had me on would make me so itchy, I unconsciously scratched myself raw. I've never seen my face like that. It was bright red, peeling, and so sensitive that even water stung like crazy. Within a couple of days, it hardened into a painful, scaly mask of horror. Y'all, I wish I had a pic for some before &amp; after action but it was just too horrible to document. So what did I do? Well, I ignored the prevailing wisdom to leave my skin alone let it heal on its own because this is AB and AB solves everything. ^duh!

In the hospital, I slathered myself with Tosowoong Propolis Sparkle Ampoule, Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream, and Hanyul Rice Essential Moisture Cream since they were the most soothing things on hand. They didn't make it better but they didn't make it worse.

Once I got home, the intense recovery masking sequence began!

* **[Tofunomoritaya Yogurt Pack](http://amzn.com/B00G20QNVC)** This walk-off mask is extremely thick, cooling, and soothing but doesn't honestly have any other lasting effects. I left it on for about 15 minutes and it eliminated the itching, burning discomfort and started to soften up the hard scaly bits.
* **[Skinfood Black Sugar Honey Wash-Off Mask](http://amzn.com/B00MAATE5K)** I delicately patted this on and let it sit for 10 minutes before very gently rubbing off the dead, flaky skin that was already trying to come off. I knew it's a terrible idea to physically exfoliate irritated skin but I took great care to only rub hard enough to remove the skin that was crusty and dead. This let me get to the raw, irritated skin underneath, which needed some major TLC.
* **[Skinfood Royal Honey Mask](http://www.roseroseshop.com/skinfood-sample-royal-honey-mask-samples-10pcs.html)** This is not a sugar scrub like the previous mask, it's a smooth, clear, healing wash-off miracle worker. Smeared on the whole sample, left it on for 10 minutes and rinsed it off. Finally my skin was starting to look like itself again.
* **[MBD Royal Jelly Sheet Mask](http://amzn.com/B006ORGR4G)** Bee things seemed to be working so I just ran with it. No regrets.
* **[Tosowoong Propolis Sparkle Ampoule](http://www.roseroseshop.com/tosowoong-propolis-sparkle-ampoule-100ml.html)** Sweet elixir of glowy delight! 
* **[COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream](http://www.roseroseshop.com/cosrx-advanced-snail-92-all-in-one-cream-100ml.html)** It's just so pleasant. Made my skin bouncy, which is amazing because up until this point, my skin was the opposite of bouncy.
* **[Hanyul Rice Essential Moisture Cream](http://www.roseroseshop.com/hanyul-rice-essential-moisture-cream-50ml.html)** Mild, soothing, and moisturizing, just what the doctor ordered.
* **[Laneige Water Sleeping Pack](http://www.target.com/p/laneige-water-sleeping-mask-80-ml/-/A-14897252)** Mmmmm sealed all that goodness in with a big dollop of something cooling and dependable.

What is happening to this subreddit? 


I used to see posts with random funny pictures all the time and I laughed and smiled because I just enjoyed them, even if they do seem ""spammy."" And now they're getting downvoted like crazy?


And it's not just these posts, it's posts from people asking for help and asking questions too which honestly is my biggest concern. Isn't it part of our mission as a subreddit to help people who are venturing into AB? Every experienced person here was once of those people and we all know what it felts like to be completely lost. And it's not just beginners. Even veterans who have questions about a specific product or are encountering a problem they never had before are being downvoted. So why are posts getting downvoted when they should be getting attention?

I honestly can't tell if it's just the downvote trolls or that this subreddit has really changed that much. And it just makes me really sad. To be completely honest, I've also been wanting to check the subreddit much less frequently these days and I've noticed that a lot of the regulars aren't here as often as well.


So let me ask you all again, what is happening to this subreddit?


Edit: To all of you that are downvoting comments simply because you disagree with them. Let me remind you that that's not what the downvote button for is at all. If you disagree, leave a comment so we can have a discussion about this. Downvoting and not saying anything doesn't get us *anywhere.*",1576,280,asian_beauty

Can you share your favorite oil cleansers with me? I ran out of innisfree green tea oil cleanser and it did not wow me.

oohshite,"So bummed out and I need your advice - Hello lovelies, 
So, just as bit of background, I been using AB products for about a couple of months with some amazeballs results.  But, as I didn't have any AB cleansers, I was using baby oil as my 1st cleanser and Ole Henrickson Red Tea Foam as my 2nd cleanser.  Both of these seemed to be working pretty nicely actually and I never had any sort of tightness or dryness once cleansed. 
Anywho long story short, after reading up I ordered and just received the long awaited Tosowoong's enzyme powder cleanser.  I've used it twice so far and I'm sure you can guess by the title, it's not working for me so far. 
I have still continued to use the baby oil as my first cleanser ( I have Banila co clean it zero on the way) but after using the Tosowoong my skin feels super tight, dry and sensitive. Even my beloved, oh so soothing Mizon snails AIO, feels a little stingy when I first apply it. üò±
So my question to you lovelies is, do I give up on my new fandangled wash completely or does my skin just need a little time to adjust to it. I'm super conscious of ruining my moisture barrier and all my bloody success so far but at the same time, I don't want to give up on a potentially awesome product.

republicansex,"Just thinking about what AB means to me - When I first dove into AB a year ago because my once oily skin shifted dramatically to dry and cranky, I hauled like crazy, tried to slap a million things on my face, stressed about finding products to fill every step of a long routine, believing this would be the answer to my skin problems. Obviously as a sensitive skinned person this did not work for me at all, and my skin rebelled with a pimples with dry patches and fine lines fuck you. I've long been a lover of DIY and ""natural"" type skin oils and balms, which have worked very well for my skin historically, and I stressed a lot about where to put them in an AB routine. As I've read more and more of this sub and explored how many kinds of AB products there are that have different functions and ingredient combinations, expanded my ingredient awareness, and experimented a lot, and also acknowledged that sometimes an AB routine can have steps that don't include Asian products, I've realized how, for me, the beauty of AB lies in how customizable it is, and the understanding of my skin as an organism that's constantly in flux. Learning to understand its tendencies best, some days layering steam creams over face oils over serums I wake up bouncy, and other days all I need is a touch of coconut/tea tree oil and mineral sunscreen after washing my face with Thayer's witch hazel.

YvonneIsNot,"Daily Grit City for 6 months. Products working or clogging? - I love oil cleansing nightly with my Banila Co. Clean It Zero. I've gotten 3 to 5 grits with other oil cleansers before but the first time I used Clean It Zero, I got face full of black, short and thin needle like grits. It went on for 3 days. Then, I got much smaller, shorter grits, along with little oil clogs (soft and hard). Almost 6 months later, I still get them nightly. The amount varies but it's still significant amount even when it's not a ton. 

I still have a stubborn patch of CCs on my chin and every other month or so might get a cystic acne or two (hormonal) but have had no new acne for about 1.5 months (other than a new product-related break out about a week ago that are all gone).  I get the most amount of grits on my cheeks and around my eyes. Other than BB cushion and brow pencil, I don't wear any other makeup daily. I almost never break out on my cheeks and these days, my cheeks are SO soft. My whole face is softer than it's ever been, but my cheeks are extra soft. 

My questions are: does anyone else get daily grits and have been for an extended amount of time?  Do you think I should reevaluate my routine and products?  Are my products working or are they clogging my pores?

What kind of ""experience"" do they offer? Are they like ""creamy"" powders but not so creamy like a BB cream or foundation? how do they apply on the skin and how do they perform? do they offer more coverage than powders?

GiveMeABreak25,"Why we love this sub, let us count the ways! - In light of the more recents threads discussing what people don't like around here, let's do something else.

Let's talk about the many ways and reasons and things we like about this sub.

Not long ago (as in literally minutes ago), I got a package from a fellow Ab'r of glorious sheet masks. It happened very innocently. I asked a question or something in the daily thread about luscious sheet masks that had heavy essence in preparation for the cold weather. /u/katmar13 spoke up about some ones she knew of that I had not mentioned which led to us exchanging messages, her letting me know she had surplus and us working out $$ for me to help *lighten her mask load* ;).

[This is what came](http://imgur.com/rR0fqXu). Not just the sheet masks, some samples I have not  gotten of things I have not tried and a sweet note.

 I  have also sent masks etc to fellow ab'rs for fun. It's just a fun thing to do and it's nice to spread the AB love. I have had a very hard couple weeks in my personal life and as silly as it seems, this is probably the best thing that will happen in my day today. 

Likewise, I have made a few cool ""friends"" and even more acquaintances that I stay in touch with outside of the sub. People I can ask questions of or share stories with or gush over hauls with.
And I hope that continues.

So besides having super nice skin now (except for currently where I went hog wild on my face and am now paying for my ideals that I have teflon skin) I have found a very sweet community. To me, sweet doesn't always include unicorns and snails. Sometimes it's much more real life-like. I appreciate that. I appreciate this sub for that. I appreciate this sub even when I am in the wrong and someone let's me know.

Anyway. I would love for this thread to be filled up with good things that have occurred for you, little bright spots in your day, from being part of this community.

ladymel0ns,"Thoughts on M-61 Powerful Skincare products? - Hey ABers!


I stopped by this store in NYC called bluemercury because the shop looked really nice and the sales people were very friendly and not pushy! It's pretty much all western brands but I'm a sucker for a nice looking stores :X! 


I popped in to grab a gift for a friend who's looking into starting a skincare regime of her own and ended up picking out a product from the brand M-61 Powerful Skincare, called Power Cleanse Pore-Purifying Glycolic Face Cleanser (for combo/oily skin types).


Ingredients: Water, cocamidopropyl betaine, glycolic acid, polysorbate 20, cocamidopropylamine oxide, ethoxdiglycol, polyquaternium-10, melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil (tea tree), phytic acid, camellia sinensis leaf extract, pathenol, glycerin, disodium EDTA, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate.



I was wondering if anyone has any experience using this product or others from the M-61 line, there's a handful of different products. Any thoughts, comments, concerns? I'm interested in gathering opinions from you ladies and gents because, to me, you are the best source of knowledge!

nariennandill,"ElsaGusa brand now available on ebay - Some time ago I stumbled upon [this essence] (http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d89f173028.html) on cosdna. In my ongoing ceramide love, I tried googling it and found [their offical site](http://www.elsagusa.com/) + two links to this sub. I fell in love with their super cute comic style site and packagings! I hope they work as good as they look :D I've learned it's available on BGO, but I'm not super comfortable ordering from there. So I randomly emailed an ebay seller that offers My Scheming and Lovemore masks, with a thought ""worst case, they say no, and that's it"" and also as a training in overcoming social anxiety. To my surprise, they said it's no problem and they're going to list the brand! I've checked today and some products are already available, just not yet the ones I want, lol. I decided to let you guys know, I'm not affiliated with the seller in any way, I just thought it's a nice thing to do after they were so kind to cater to my request! Here's the [store](http://stores.ebay.com/beautyinaclick/) :)

Taiwanese brands don't get much spotlight here, so if anyone has any reviews of this brands products, please share!

kstoops2conquer,"Beauteque [Haul] and Hanaka Intensive Renewal Mask (Mandelic Acid) Mini Review - I ordered this little [haul](http://imgur.com/hVeqLJY) during Beauteque's 30% off event:

- The Face Shop Real Nature Masks in Honey and Kelp

- Two Hanaka Magic Garden Series Rose + Transexamic Acid Sheet Masks

- Two FaceQ Sake Yeast Brightening Masks

- E Choice Fermented Tea Sleeping Pack

- and two Etude House I Need You Masks (Vita Complex) (they threw in a third!)

But I mostly placed the order for the Hanaka Intensive Renewal Mandelic Acid Mask ($24) because of the adorable [packaging](http://imgur.com/t0oEbWR). Also, my face loves acid.

It's a jelly-textured wash-off mask that comes with it's own [spatula](http://imgur.com/R8b402n) and smells of floral laundry detergent.  Quite strongly, but fades on the face and isn't unpleasant.  But if floral laundry detergent would give you a headache this is not the mask for you.

I tried the mask this morning and was pleased but not overwhelmed.  The mask has a cooling texture on application - I'm uncertain of the concentration of mandelic acid (CosDNA analysis [here](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_32f4142503.html), but it does have a little bite on first application.  I left the mask on for ten minutes - I've now seen instructions that say it can stay on for up to 20 which I'll try next time.  

I got brightening from this mask - nowhere near as dramatically as a good sheet mask, but still a definite diminuation of dullness such that this would be nice before going to an event.  In spite of the glycerin this did leave my skin feeling a little parched, so I could definitely see giving a one-two punch of Hanaka Intensive Renewal Mandelic Acid Mask to exfoliate and tone and then a hydrating sheet mask to hydrate and plumpen the freshly exfoliated skin.

All in all, I'm pleased - although not obsessed/enthralled/enraptured - with this mask, was pleased with the Beauteque experience, and here is a picture of [my favorite cat.](http://imgur.com/kC24Hd5)",2015,324,asian_beauty

I'm looking at buying a new BB cream. I've used the etude house bright fit w24 years ago and I loved the coverage, however I see that it s now discontinued. The w24 looked a little bit off on my skin - I think because it was more of a pinky undertone and a little too dark.

I'm trying to decide between perfect fit, blooming fit, and the cover and bright fit.

I can't find reviews on the cover and bright fit online, and I am confused with perfect and blooming fit. Some people say blooming fit has sheer coverage and others say it has medium coverage? (Of course I know it depends on what people want to cover..)

Anyway, if I could have your opinions/advice on shade recommendation, finish, etc. on these 3 BB creams that would be good.

- I am a little lighter than NC30 (yellow undertone skin)
- Need coverage for my PIH
- I like thin/high coverage consistencies
- Prefer satin/slightly dewy finish/natural (not extremely dewy because my skin gets oilier throughout the day)

Within that post, I provided [before and after pictures](http://imgur.com/a/RhPnz) of my semi-permanent tattoos.    

I ended up being able to come back for a touch up, and I have more photos to share for anyone interested in my eyebrow tattooing progress.    


First off, here's a [makeup-less snapchat](http://imgur.com/a/loGDB#UaJ0SRE) of me a couple weeks before I went in for my touch up. I was already very happy with how my eyebrows turned out after the initial procedure, but I decided that since the touch-up would be a complimentary service that I might as well go for it.       

Because I look great in this picture, [here's an example](http://imgur.com/a/loGDB#17yfFKJ) of what my brows look like when I use Anastasia dipbrow to fill them in. My tattoos help in that I'm not starting from scratch everytime I go in to do my brows.    

I got the touch-up done this past Tuesday, 8/25. Here is RIGHT BEFORE the procedure, after the technicians drew their [design on my eyebrows](http://imgur.com/ARfLMpr)! I was very happy with the design they did. They used a black eyebrow pencil for the design, but did my actual tattoo with a dark brown ink.    

[Here's about 12 hours after the procedure](http://imgur.com/a/loGDB#ia3Vu6U). I'm sweaty in this pic, but I hope you can see how red my eyebrows still are. They're also shiny from the vaseline coating.    


[24 hours after procedure](http://imgur.com/a/loGDB#xkzOOEe). My eyebrows look a lot better, but still a little too thick and dark for my taste.    

[48 hours after procedure,](http://imgur.com/a/loGDB#fx0Oxzr). Pretty much the same.    

[72 hours after procedure](http://imgur.com/a/loGDB#IOceQAA).  Brows are a lot less red and a little thinner. I still felt they had some more healing to do.    

[81 hours after procedure](http://imgur.com/a/loGDB#iWLKuea). I took this just an hour ago. I consider them to be fully healed by now.    

I hope you can tell through the progress that while the brows are still healing, you can see the thick tattoo strokes. After healing, these strokes get softer, and thus brows are much more natural looking.    

Lastly, in the style of the before and afters I provided two months ago, here are close ups of my [right](http://imgur.com/a/loGDB#1iC9yjP) and [left](http://imgur.com/a/loGDB#902uypD) eyes.

Unfortunately I can't remember who mentioned it on here, but they talked about DETClear Bright and Clear Fruit Enzyme Powder Wash with AHA and BHA.  

Sounds amazing right?  I Googled it and saw that [RatzillaCosme](http://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/best-pick-detclear-bright-peel-fruits-enzymes-powder-wash/) named it as a best pick.  Even better!

I whip out some pH strips expecting a 5.5 because of all the fruit extracts and acids, and [here are the results](http://imgur.com/9qjkv4U).

But, what about your favourite products for when the weather gets colder? Not just for the wind, rain and snow, but how do you deal with your skin overreacting when it comes to central heating and (less common, but still have an effect) coal/wood fires?

WindieG,"[Rave] Dermal bamboo sheet mask kicking my forehead acne/closed comedone's butt?! - So I've had forehead issues for just under a year. It just consistently breaks out, and in the past few months closed comedones have been an issue. After having an unfortunate breakout from the Biore Perfect Face Milk (SO SAD because it felt wonderful, it was probably the alcohol that got me), I was looking for a way to calm my skin. Spotted the Dermal sheet mask at an H-Mart in my neighbourhood, saw it was packed with aloe and bamboo which just sounds nice and soothing, and contained no alcohol. 

After using it, my skin was just... ridiculously calm. I just injected it into my regular routine, so it's the only thing that I think could have caused the change. I've been using them pretty frequently for the past two weeks and my skin is just constantly improving, it's honestly amazing. I'm assuming it's the anti-inflammatory properties of aloe and bamboo? Regardless of what it is, it's blowing my mind. My forehead's texture hasn't looked this good in ages.

My skin isn't perfect yet, but this is a HUGE step in the right direction, I feel awesome when I wake up and see my skin looking a bit better every day. And if anyone has any similar or better sheet mask recommendations, I am all ears :)

It's a lightweight, sebum-resistant, essence type sunscreen that reminds me a lot of Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence in some ways but is different in others. The biggest issue I've had with this sunscreen is that it doesn't like to absorb, especially at sufficient quantities (1/4 tsp for my face), and leaves a film on my skin. Without makeup though, I would definitely not use this sunscreen because it makes me look really shiny (not *as* bad as Hada Labo UV Creamy Gel but still bad) but strangely enough, wearing this sunscreen under makeup helps prevent my makeup from flaking (I've got dry skin) and I suspect that filmy layer has something to do with it. 

I will not be repurchasing this sunscreen, but it seems like sunkiller makes a lot of other sunscreens, some of which are very popular and highly regarded in these parts, particularly the perfect strong plus or perfect strong moisture, so I definitely have my eye on those the next time I do a rakuten order.",1250,205,asian_beauty
GiveMeABreak25,"Random PSA regarding Mizon Good Night White and those looking for a gentle but effective moisturizer! - Sorry these two things have nothing to do with each other, just a couple bits of info I have been wanting to pass on and am just getting around to it.

A lot of us use and highly recommend **Mizon Good Night White Sleeping pack**. It's the most luscious final step to my routine and I have been hooked on it since I started using it. I cannot say enough good things about it! 

From the beginning for me, I have always used the tube version. Travels well, cheap, no jar, etc etc. My last haul was from ViewtyCos and I was in need but they only had the version in the jar. Bummer but, I bought it anyway. I noticed something else, the name seemed to be different. When I purchase this in the tube it is called *Special Solution* Good Night White. The jar I was looking at in my order was called *Special Therapy* Good Night White. I thought perhaps this was a yearly package change or something.

Until before I received it, another poster mentioned receiving the Special Therapy jar and it being occlusive feeling and needing more than a rinse in the AM. That was a bit puzzling as I have never felt this pack was occlusive and it rinses well for me in the mornings. 

So, I finally got my jar and lo and behold, the Special Therapy version *is* more occlusive. It still works the same but, I think I will prefer that formula in the winter months verses the Special Solution which is less occlusive.

So, just a PSA. I have not been able to track down why they are different, what the pro's/con's might be other than what I have observed. I don't *think* it's just a new formulation but I am not positive either. [Here are the two side by side](http://www.roseroseshop.com/index.php?route=product/search&amp;search=mizon%20good%20night%20white) (RRS link)

Ok, so-on to my second PSA

If you have very sensitive and dry skin OR you have experienced a big whoopsie like I do at times of messing up my moisture barrier/over doing it with actives or have any other sensitive condition but still need a good moisturizer, I cannot rave enough about [Innisfree The Minimum Moist Cream For Sensitive Skin](http://www.innisfreeworld.com/product/productView.do?prdSeq=10083&amp;eventSeq=0&amp;catCd01=UA)

IMO, everyone should have a tube of this handy for when they have over stripped or otherwise screwed up, and for those who are ultra sensitive, it's a must have.

The last two weeks I have gone a little over board with actives and screwed up my face. I was starting to feel burning with some products so I knew I have made a mistake. Putting that cream on as a final step in a modified but gentle routine has been a godsend.

pizzapunch123,"Any ladies who were affected by the Benton contamination? - This is not meant to be be a vicious, finger-pointing type of post. I just want to ask for some honest advice, because I am just really tired of having all these skin issues. 

About a year ago (last August), I tried the Benton Snail Bee Essence, and unfortunately, received a contaminated batch. Since I didn't have experience at the time, I used the essence all over my face. In any case, it got really bad over the year. Cystic acne, closed comedones, the like.

My issue now is that almost a year later, even though the cystic acne has subsided, and I don't get many active pimples any more, I still have all these tiny, minuscule, flesh-colored bumps dotting my skin. It kind of makes my skin look like chicken skin.

So my question for any of the ladies who were affected by the same thing: Are there any of you who are completely ""over"" the contamination problems (well as ""over"" as you can possibly be)? As in, are there any of you who no longer get those weird bumps and whose skin is back to ""normal"" (aside from whatever indented scars you may have sustained from the incident)?

Kchancan,"The Quintessential Asian Beauty Juice Cleanse - Hello Ladies and Gentleman,

My contribution to this subreddit is a Chinese(Cantonese) family recipe to treat and prevent hormonal acne without having to apply anything directly on your skin. Also, this is good for anybody that had chest/back acne so they don't want to use product on their face AND their acne affected body. 

For those of you that aren't ready yet to make the plunge on products on your skin, I would suggest you try drinking one glass of the juice (6-8 oz) once a day for a week and see if you notice a change. If you do, I would continue for 2 weeks and from there see if you still need to add product to your regiment. I don't really follow asian medicine to crazily and I can't remember what my Godmother said to me back when I was a kid about this, but the basic premise with this juice cleanse specifically is that acne is caused by an imbalance of hormones. The juice ""cleanses"" you of what loosley translates to ""hot air"" and it is a very ""refreshing"" drink that cools your body down so your body's hormones can go back to normal. Scientifically speaking, the veggies and fruits have lots of Vitamin C and nutrients that help replenish your skin cells. It is also probably because most Americans do not eat enough veggies or fruits that this juice will essentially provide you what your body wants/needs/lacks, which will then prompt your skin to heal itself too. 

You will notice the following side affects though YMMV: Day 1 to Day 3 - your face and any acne on your chest or back will gradually stop being inflamed. Day 4/5 Cystic acne will not feel so hard. By the end of the week you should start noticing your acne and zits ""dry up"". After week 1 you should not see any ""new"" zits spring up. Rather, any remaining zits will dry themselves up until you see a noticeable difference. Your back acne will also dry up and you will not feel any bumps otherwise on your back. The redness will gradually dissapear and whats remaining will be any scaring left and darker spots. Eventually the spots will go away too but you will need to juice for a longer period for this to successfully happen.

I should note this is a recipe handed down generation to generation but in general the ingredients for the juice cleanse are known in general to be very good for the skin. I have changed the amount of ingredient usage but the ingredients themselves have never changed. If anything, I will add more apples if I find the bitter melon to be too bitter. 

The recipe serves easily enough juice to last a week if not more (depending on the size of the veggies). You can store it in containers and freeze/refrigerate. Do not keep for longer than a week though as you want to drink this as fresh as possible :) Take one glass full a day until your juice runs out. I juice every sunday and store for the rest of the week. I take out one container from the freezer and let it melt away in the fridge overnight, so I can drink it in the morning before I start my day. 

Eventually, you will have clear enough skin (and balanced hormones) so that you only need to drink the juice twice a week or even once a week during non-stressed periods. I only drink it daily when I was a student in finals week or have a few heavy work weeks. 

Note: Bitter melon can be found in your local asian market. Find the ones that when you wrap your hand aronud it and give it a firm squeeze, the skin is firm and it pushes up against your press. 

4 Bitter Melons (remove sides and core)
8 Green Apples (remove core)
4 Medium/Large Green Peppers (remove seeds and core)
2 Cucumbers 
1 stalk of celery 

*If you do not like the bitter taste the bitter melon gives, add more apples/peppers. But absolutely do not remove from the juice list. Bitter melon also has lots of good side affects, specifically for people with diabetes. 

*I hate the texture of pulp, so I double/triple strain so I only have the juice. 
 
Last note: Regardless of whether you want product or not on your skin I still think the basicas like moistorizer and sunscreen are important. 

If there is enough interest I may make a video so you can see what the ingredients look like and how I prepare. 

Good luck and let me know if anybody sees a difference in their skin!",4283,790,asian_beauty

mizliu,"This product instantly mattifies oily skin! - So I started looking into AB products right when the season started warming up and I mistakenly thought my skin was getting oiler because of the weather. For my essence, I decided on buying the Innisfree Green Persimmon Pore Essence, which claims to shrink pores and keep oil at bay. I found out later that the culprit for my oilier skin was my western sunscreen...but I've still been using this essence just because. My pores aren't big to begin with so I hadn't seen any difference. Now, I've noticed that certain sheet masks will leave my skin oilier than usual when I wake up, worst culprit is Innisfree It's Real Squeeze in Kiwi. Last night I used up my last one and attempted to smooth on my sleeping pack on top of it - BIG MISTAKE. I looked in the mirror and my skin was so ""oily"" it was almost dripping. I had a lightbulb go off in my head and I immediately got out my essence, used my usual 3 pumps, and swiped one finger on my forehead.

Results were instantaneous! 

My forehead wasn't oily-feeling anymore and was just soft. I quickly used a few more pumps and covered my whole face in the essence and marveled at how fast the ""oils"" went away.

This particular product is obviously not going to work for me, but I had high hopes for snail in general because you lovely ladies say such great things about it (this was my first try at using anything snail, but I have a couple of masks from RRS I'm awaiting the arrival of).

My skin is pretty sensitive and eczema prone, and I know I'm sensitive to arnica which is in this, but it's pretty low down on the list of ingredients, and that usually burns or stings, not itches.

But even knowing this, sometimes it's a bit hard for me to wrap my mind around topics in Get It Beauty. 

Most often it's because of how they treat male/female dynamics. There are so many episodes that are based around ""this is how to attract guys"" and ""this is what guys find attractive"" which just seems...so weird to me. In America I think the idea that ""beauty is for the individual"" tends to be emphasized. Not to mention, not everyone is straight, and it feels like they'd be alienating their gay audience.

[deleted],"Eye cream advice for under-40's! - Since somebody asked about this during over-40 weekend, I've given it some thought and wanted to share some ideas.

The most important piece of advice I think I came up with it to use eye cream around your ENTIRE eye socket!  You won't know until the wrinkles start WHERE they are going to show up.  They may come under you eyes, to either side, or out at the edge of the socket itself, so to hedge your bets, get that entire area.  And DO use eye cream even if the rest of your face is too oily to take creams well.  That being said, I found that when I was younger, thinner eye creams worked better, as it soaked more easily into my thicker skin.  Now that I'm older and the skin is thinner, heavier creams get sucked right in there!  

More expensive creams have never given me consistently better results, so use whatever is cheap and gentle enough for you to be able to use it every day without budget concerns or worrying about harsh reactions.  I just got a tube of Secret Key Starting Treatment Eye Cream from RRS for all of $3.96 plus shipping for a full ounce, and it's going in great.  When my PocketDerm scrip starts including tertinoin, I'll happily use that on my eye area if I can tolerate it, but until then, it's not about spending money, it's about using it every day, so use whatever fits your routine and your budget so you never go without when your finances fluctuate.  Save the heavy-duty mature skin products for when you need them, as they only treat, they don't prevent!

i_am_user_name,"Thoughts on an r/AsianBeauty Census? - So, in the subreddit for my university, we have a census just about every year to get an idea of the demographics of the people around the subreddit (although it's absolutely not representative of the actual university).

I got the idea in my head that maybe we had something similar done and, interested, I poked around a bit on the search bar. And found just about nothing that provides a ~~decent~~ full survey of this wonderful community.

So I got to thinking...

Would anyone else be interested in a census? We have nearly 25,000 subscribers (!) and the census could be open to lurkers so we, theoretically, would be able to get a fuller picture of who ABers are. 

I think that, if y'all are interested, I could put together two parts: a basic age/sex/location survey and a more detailed supplemental one that is more specific to this community. 

Personally, I believe this would not only be interesting, but valuable. Bloggers could have an idea of who's around and what they'd like to see. Maybe we could include a few questions of what we'd like to see more/less of to make the subreddit better. I also have a feeling we're a fairly diverse place and it would be nice to have a way for people who aren't as represented to look so they could be reminded they're not the only ones!

Any thoughts, ideas, or questions on this would be lovely! I want to put it together, but I won't if people aren't interested or think it's a bad idea. Also, if the moderators think it wouldn't be good for the subreddit, they are welcome to shut it down completely.

**tl;dr:** I'd like to put together a survey to get an idea of who is around this subreddit and want some input from the community.

cococolon,"foundation/cushion compact that won't make one's skin flakey? - A friend of mine recently over the last few months started having issues with being able to use any kind of foundation/bb cream/cushion compact on her face without it causing major flakiness all over. She said she hasn't changed her routine and hasn't used anything new, and looking at her face when it's bare faced, it doesn't look too dry or too oily, seems very well maintained; and she doesn't really have any big skin issues, besides the usual wanting a bit of anti aging for prevention and maintaining glowy skin (but doesn't really have issues with acne, or oiliness, etc). But she likes to wear makeup for work to look more polished but currently is unable to. Any idea what she could do about it or what's causing it?

Her routine seems normal, and unchanged for a while. She likes all the products in it and has had no issues with any of them:

- fancl cleansing oil
- SKII FTE
- Dr. Obagi vit c serum 
- Loveisderma (a taiwanese brand) b5 serum
- Clinique dramatically different cream
- one of the anessa sunscreens 

She doesn't use any aha/bha in her routine, but does an AHA peel every now and then at the derm's. It doesn't seem like that's an issue either as she's been doing that for years. 

Her go to foundation before was estee lauder double wear (she likes long lasting formulas) but now it just makes her flakey. She has tried a couple of cushion compacts (thinking maybe something lighter would help) from innisfree, etude house, and iope but all of them made her skin flakey in a similar way. 

I have no clue why her skin is fine otherwise but with face makeup it flakes up everywhere, and why it was fine in the past? Any ideas?",1719,312,asian_beauty

I have puffy eyes from heredity and from the fact that I have terrible insomnia. I also have dark circles. Awesome, huh? I know that basically there's not much you can do for dark circles. (Oh, I also suffer from allergies!). I bought this on a whim from aliexpress since it was only a couple of $ and it was actually my first AB product! The snail thing just caught my eye. 
It took awhile to get into the habit of using it since eye products were not part of my routine. But once I did, I really notice a difference in puffiness. I feel my undereye circles have also lightened up noticeably. Can't speak for wrinkles since I really only have them when I smile (and those are good, right?). I've been using tretonion for years including the entire eye area, so I have that to thank.

They're my go-to summer/lazy makeup when I just don't feel like wearing heavy foundation.  Before I knew about Asian BB creams, I tried out several Western ones, namely Stila, Smashbox, Maybelline, and NYX.  Every single one of them were runny and greasy, more like tinted moisturizer/sunscreen and didn't cover up anything or do anything for my redness.  I have oily skin, so anything with that sort of consistency is bad news for me--the creamy consistency of Asian BB creams is just right for me.  I got home today to my mother going on and on about how she found this BB cream at Kohl's for $5, that was originally $20-something.  I got excited because she made it sound like she had found something /really/ good (given that Kohl's makeup section is mostly off-brand stuff).  She showed it to me and it wasn't even a brand that I'd heard of (it came in a blue and white box. I don't remember the name off the top of my head).  I swatched it on the back of my hand and, sure enough, it had the consistency of a sunscreen/moisturizer with a tint and all but absorbed into the back of my hand, not really covering anything up at all.

Some pimples here and there but nothing like the kind of acne I used to have. I started taking a birth control pill (Minastrin 24 fe) exactly 8 days ago. 

Around 2 days ago (5/6 days into the birth control) I broke out suddenly all over my chin! Like wow, I've never had chin acne like that in my life! I never break out here and I had around 4-5 pimples, that were cyst like. I also had a few super tiny white head like pimples (super small) around my face (maybe 5 but barely noticeable unless you stare up close). 

I have only added one product for the past 3 weeks, the shara shara honey bomb and I don't think this is the problem because if it was wouldn't I have broken out around my face? I barely put any of this product on my chin anyways, mostly under my eyes/cheek area. I called the doctor, and she said it is 'most likely not this birth control as it should *clear up* your acne"". I'm still kind of thinking that it's the birth control because it made me ""spot/breakthrough bleeding"" (ahhh sorry I just wonder if this is an important detail) for a day just a few days after taking it. I kinda thought if this was related to the pill, then it may also be related to my skin breakout. The doctor told me to stick with it for a few weeks and if I don't like it then we can switch it.

I used it one morning and decided to wait because we had family staying for a few days and I didn't want to have to deal with purging should it happen. The next day I noticed a couple of itchy spots on my chin but I attributed it to coming in contact with some powder from latex gloves which I have a slight allergy to. Fast forward a week to this morning, I used the OST C20 again and just now I realized my cheek was itching and when I rubbed it there were small bumps all over it. I went and looked in the mirror and my cheek is pink....and my chin looks like an angry pink cauliflower! It's bad, lots of itchy bumps, some are weepy. Now, to throw a wrench into trying to sort this out: I used a different My Scheming mask both times I used the vit. C so I have no idea which it was that caused the reaction! I have never had a bad reaction to a mask before and their ingredients seem pretty basic. It's easy not to use the masks again but I don't want to try the vit C again either because this pretty much sucks.

The only other BHA I've tried is Stridex and it dried the hell out of my skin. I think alcohol makes my skin flush, but I only know this from sheet masks.

WearsFatSteps,"My Scheming Snail Essence Hydrating and Repairing Black Mask - I had my first snafu with an AB product last night when I used an Innisfree mask (rose flavored) with a high alcohol content.  Let's just say that everywhere the mask touched my face turned a nice tomato red and you could see a clear outline of the  mask on my forehead after the mask was gone.  Users in the IRC chat recommended that I put some aloe or some snails on it.  I had a free My Scheming Snail Essence Hydrating &amp; Repairing black mask that came with a box of HA masks.  

Here's a [link](http://www.amazon.com/My-Scheming-Essence-Hydrating-Repairing/dp/B00PKNYQMK) of the mask from Amazon. 

**Ingredients from the back of the pack**

water, glycerin, buytlene glycol, hydroxyethyl urea, cucumis sativus (cucumber fruit extract), chondrus crispus (carageenan), hydroxethyl ethylcellulouse, niacinamide, sodium hyaluronate, xantham gum, cestrum latifolium leaf extract, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, snail secretion filtrate, arginine, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, methylisothiazolinone, fragrance.  

Snail is pretty far down on the ingredients list.  The mask does market itself as hydrating first.

**The Essence**

Like any My Scheming mask, this was full of essence.  I squeezed out the excess and it's the amount I use for lotion on my body.  It was literally running out of my hands.  I put some on neck, arms, legs, and the weird eczema patch on my leg.  I tried to take a picture of the package and had to wipe some essence off and more spilled out.  I put more essence on my legs (hey, I shaved today, they can use the moisture).  I tried to clean the package a second time and even more goop came out and I put more goop on the eczema.  I got a snapshot for my instagram, but I'm pretty sure my phone got snails in the process.  

**Fit**

There was a little extra space on my forehead.  The ear portion oddly goes a little further back that most masks so my little sideburns are well snailed.  

**The Verdict**

The mask worked as promised.  My skin is much hydrated and a bit calmer.  I feel like the black part is a bit gimmicky; it's a sheet mask.  

Bonus:  This mask is hella scary looking.  It scared my cat.  She stopped and stared at me nervously whilst passing by.  If you want to scare the shit out of your family, friends, and mail carrier--this mask is for you.  It's right up there with the rubbery Daiso mask in creepiness.   

Would I buy it again?  If the price was right.  I haven't seen these guys out in the wild, but box of 8 black masks are selling for the same price as box of 10 normal ones on Amazon.  Maybe I'll try a few more if they call out to me, but I'm not buying a box anytime soon.

Pink_alpaca13,"About Asian skincare products. -    Hello everyone! First time poster here. I've been reading a lot about Asian sunscreens and BB creams and I've been wanting to try them so badly because they just look like they sink in so smoothly while giving good coverage. The problem is: I've had an awful experience with Asian skincare about two years back. My skin wasn't bad, but it most definetly wasn't great. I stopped by my local Asian market and picked up some Japanese skin care line called Hadanomy, because what the heck, right? (I don't know if this is a Japanese drug store equivalent or if it's a bit higher end than drugstore or what. I asked my Japanese friend in Japan, and she said she'd never heard of it.)
  
 I bought some foaming cleanser that was also Japanese, but not by Hadanomy, and the serum and moisturizer by Hadanomy. I used these for about a week before my face became a pimply mess. My skin was red and inflamed and I had big under the skin pimples in addition to whiteheads. I gave it a few more weeks, since I knew skin needs time to adjust sometimes, and it just got worse. I stopped using it, and long story short, my skin is now clear 98% of the time thanks to oatmeal. 
   
My question is: are Asian sunscreens and BB creams so different from American sunscreens and BB creams in their ingredients, like the cleansers and moisturizers seem to be? I know I've read somewhere about certain ingredients used in American skin care lines not being allowed in Japan. I really want to use these products because obviously, Asia knows whassup when it comes to skincare, but I'm so afraid of breaking out again. Oddly enough, I can use the missha snail repair creme and Korean and Japanese cosmetics with no problem.",1735,312,asian_beauty

[deleted],"Derma rolling round 3! - Hi! 

Okay so this time around I used a 1.5mm roller, and did not rub alcohol all over my face before rolling. I did wash my face thoroughly and applied numbing cream. waited about 20-30 mins, wiped face with wet towel, rinsed face with cold water before rolling. 

I did not press as hard as I did with the 1.0 for fear of leaving marks like last time. The 1.5mm is much more painful than the 1.0!!!! Rolling on my forehead was an interesting feeling. It tickled but hurt at the same time. I had tears coming down while giggling. Maybe has something to do with numbing cream? 

I did not bleed as much this time, but thinking I would play it safe since this is the first time with a longer needle. 

I will try to update with results! 

Oh FYI, I did not really notice any results from rolling with the 1.0mm ( 2 sessions). My skin has gotten much softer, but that could be due to warmer weather and taking better care of my skin overall.

Nevertheless, I still want to try other cushions because I love how easy it was to use and how I looked with it on (prior to the breakout, of course). However, I ended up looking at the ingredients of other cushions like the IOPE Air Cushion XP, AmorePacific Color Control (the Sephora one), Hera UV Mist, and the Verite UV Multicushion, and they all have the same acne-triggering ingredients (Ethylhexyl Palmitate and Isopropyl Palmitate aka fragrances) as the cushion I used.

Any recommendations? I'm looking into the Laneige Pore Control BB Cushion because there don't seem to be any wildly triggering ingredients, but I don't want to be disappointed again.

KnowledgeHunterer,"24 M. Face is exposed while swimming and gets pitch black within a few hours. How do I choose the best sunscreen in my case? - Hello there. 


I am a South-Asian, or Bangladeshi to be exact. My complexion is wheatish on the brown spectrum. The thing is I swim for 4 days a week for two hours a day. My swimming times are at mid-day and I could not find an indoor pool in my city. Neither could I find a pool with swimming times in the evening. 

Anyways, this Monday, in just a single one hour session, my exposed skin turned nearly black. I wear a full sleeved swimming shirt and a pair of full swimming pants. However, my face, neck and ears are exposed to the sun and they get black really quickly. 

I am planning on buying a sunscreen. Any suggestions on how I can choose the best one?

TouchaCat,"Daiso Sheet Mask Tablets - [Link to album](http://imgur.com/a/sD5HU)

I bought these from my local Daiso for NZ$3.50. There are 10 in a pack, meaning the masks are 35c each - not bad. 

The masks come in a plastic tray which has a built-in hydrating well. The section that the mask tablets are in is covered by a firm-fitting clear cover. 

I used my leftover LuLuLun 7 day mask essence to hydrate one mask tablet. The mask tablet absorbed quite a lot of essence, probably more than what you'd typically be left with for a single sheet mask, so if you wanted to use these tablets as a way of using up leftover sheet mask essence, you probably won't have nicely saturated masks. 

I should have taken a photo of the tablet in the hydrating well - it grew like a tower!

The mask itself is of decent quality material - certainly better than the LuLuLun masks but nowhere near as good as MBD. 

However, the fit is bizarre! It's very wide and short, even on my wide, short face. Sheet masks usually go past my hairline but this wasn't even close. Not to mention the flappy gills by my ears. The eye holes were alse very far apart, and the nose flap wasn't long enough to cover my short nose. Mouth hole was fine.

I'm trying to imagine the face of some who this mask would fit properly - it would be more wide than long. 

That's pretty much all I have to say about this product. I'm disappointed, the packaging is well designed but the shape of the mask is a deal-breaker.

**TL;DR**

* Missha M Magic Cushion Moisture!
* Silky/satiny finish, not super dewy but definitely not matte
* Can be cakey/dry in acne/CC areas
* Can get into eye wrinkle creases
* Evens out reddness and uneven skintone
* Not so much darker blemishes like freckles (didn't apply on acne scars so idk sorry ;_; )

I'm really excited so I wanted to share with you lovely people!! I've put off purchasing cushions for a long time because I wanted to focus on skincare first. However with the increasing popularity of all things Korean in China, Korean brands were popping up everywhere! I broken down with the deals and sales and bought 2 cushions first, Innisfree Long Wear (they didn't have Ampoule or Water Glow) and Etude House Any Cushion. Sadly both of them are more on a matte/dry side which personally I don't like much. Today I ran into a Missha store and tried the apparently new **Magic Cushion Moisture**, and I love it! A quick google told me it was new so if I'm wrong please correct me~

I'm not experience in make up or cushions at all so I can't give a good review, but first impressions right now is that it spreads nicely, and provides enough coverage for me to be happy. The finish isn't super dewy but it's really similar to my bare skin's ""dewy"" look, so I would say... silky? Satin-y? The cushion evens out skintone and color uneveness but not so much covering blemishes such as my freckles, which I don't mind. It can also look dry in areas with lots of bumpy blemishes, as I noticed under my lips where I have some CC and a recovering hormonal pimple. Can't say anything about pore covering because I didn't use it on my nose. On my undereyes it does get into my crease a little as well as look slightly splotchy, but it could possibly be remedied by primers/concealer (no idea, I'm a noob in makeup...)

But the shipping cost seems really expensive and definitely a lot more than what I figured SAL would be based on other posts/comments I've seen on here. I ordered 13 sheet masks and 1 sunscreen mist, my order total from them is 2206 yen ($18.53) and they quoted me 3200 yen ($26.88) for shipping! That more than doubles the cost of my order.

I had figured my order had a pretty low weight and the SAL shipping would be more like $10. Based on [this chart](https://www.post.japanpost.jp/int/charge/list/ems_all_en.html) 3200 yen is the shipping cost for a package up to 1.5kg, I can't imagine 13 sheet masks and a 40ml sunscreen mist in a box weigh that much.

Edit: According to [this](https://www.post.japanpost.jp/cgi-charge/result.php?lang=_en) a 1.5kg small package by SAL is 1580 yen, which is a lot closer to what I was expecting.

dappitydap,"Has anyone ever tried putting on Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion before and after a sheet mask? It's GLORIOUS. - Let me start by saying I have super dry skin. Until I found AB my skin was so dry that my forehead would shed dandruff-like foundation flakes. Yes, I drink water. AB has helped immensely helped and my facial dandruff is no more, but my skin actively resists being [~*~dew](http://imgur.com/KhW2Wx3)[ey~*~](http://imgur.com/A25QFQU). Almost everything in my routine, save for my acids and acne treatments, is mostly geared towards moisturizing. Do what 'cha gotta do.

I'm not sure if this is standard practice and I'm just behind, but the past few nights on a whim I've been putting a layer of the hadalabo lotion right before and after I put on my sheet mask. 

AND IT'S AWESOME.

It was like my skin was just sitting in suspended moisture. I'm not sure how nice that sounds to everyone else, especially those who are not lizardskin-inclined, but it seemed like I could actually *feel* it sinking in rather that just resting on my face. The next morning my skin felt softer than a royal baby's butt, but wasn't greasy or oily. It also had that nice ever so illusive glow I've been chasing. Someone even commented on how nice my skin looked - which really is the ultimate test.

Here's what I did, step by step:

* I did my normal night routine up to the hadalabo lotion. I recommend doing this at night because your face is going to be crazy moist, even if you are a lizard-person. 

* Lightly tap hadalabo lotion into your skin, however much you want. I have portion control issues so sometimes this means my decolletage and shoulders get a little moisture boost.

* Put on sheet mask before the hadalabo lotion is completely dry; I'd say when it's halfway there. Leave on the sheet mask for however long you prefer. Personally, I leave it on until it has dried out. I've been using Innisfree masks lately and those usually last 45 minutes, but they've been lasting about an hour and a half with the hadalabo.

* Remove sheet mask, let it halfway dry, and pat on some more of dat hadalabo.

* Continue the rest of your routine as normal. I would use an occlusive, just to let all the beautiful moisture know where it's gotta stay.

So if your skin is super dry definitely try this out. It's just neat. Or, if all this is old news, gently pat me on the head and welcome me to the Kingdom of Moist.",2425,435,asian_beauty

*Skin Type/Concerns*

I have normal skin that's a little on the sensitive side. I can occasionally get a little dry on my forehead, so going without cream isn't an option. I have no known allergies to common skincare ingredients, but I do best with products with just a few ingredients or natural ingredients. I have a few PIH spots and a few freckle-like spots from sun damage. I'm also a weirdo, so packaging important to me.



*What I'm Looking For/Questions*

Toner: My cream cleanser contains beeswax, so I have to use a toner to entirely get that off. My current toner is good for that, but from what I've read on Paula's Choice, it's not much good for anything else. I'm wondering if I should go for a toner with AHA or if that should be a separate part of my routine. If it should be a separate part of my routine, please explain where it would go and suggest both a toner and a AHA product.

Serum: I'm looking for a serum to prevent wrinkles and other signs of aging. My current serum burns me.

Emulsion: My only question is, is this product meant to be used as an emulsion? I absolutely adore it, but it's not very heavy and I feel like it should be followed up with a cream.

Cream: My current cream burns my skin. It's also very sticky and difficult to rub in. I'm looking for something for sensitive skin that's  heavier than the Josie Maran, but not so thick that it makes me feel like I can't let anything touch my face.

&amp;nbsp; 

While doing some hauling I found that MBD had redesigned their boxes, which led to the discovery that they are introducing at least 15 'flavors' of their Natural Key Line as hydrogels (Thanks to /u/GiveMeABreak25 who helped with the research and /u/RedRoofs for translation).   
&amp;nbsp; 

At this time it is hard to tell what is going on with the cloth masks. My personal interpretation is that the cloth masks are being phased out, although I could be very wrong. The Natural Key Line cloth masks are missing from MBD's Taiwan website. Their website and their Facebook both use the word ""upgrade"" liberally when talking about the ne hydrogel masks. In addition, the cloth masks have also been on sale on Sasa, and are being offered for $8 a box and $7.20 a box on BGO and Yahoo Taiwan respectively.   

&amp;nbsp; 

Hopefully we will be able to find out more soon. Especially because of a couple of the 'flavors' are missing from the new hydrogel line (Sake Yeast and Royal Jelly for starters).",1251,194,asian_beauty

I grabbed a few of Sephora's new face masks to try them out recently and she loved the results from the pearl mask.

Here's an ingredient list (from the Sephora website):

Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Triethanolamine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tremella Fuciformis (Mushroom) Extract, Maltodextrin, Piroctone Olamine, Lilium Candidum Bulb Extract, Polyquaternium-51, Citric Acid, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Conchiolin Powder, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate.

makemeover7,"Steam cream breakout club: what ingredient do you think was the culprit? - I unfortunately have to join the club of people who experienced bad breakouts from the Benton snail bee steam cream. It is a shame because it has such a wonderful texture. The first day I tried it I got one tiny pimple, so out of hope that I would have just gotten that pimple anyway, I used it one more time and woke up to break-out city. 

I am trying to use this as a learning experience and find out what in it broke me out. Cosdna lists the stearic acid as the most comedogenic ingredient, but I am wondering if anyone else who broke out from this cream suspects any other ingredient?

tineykitty,"Taming the Haul-Beast (Or, how my irrational love of spreadsheets and pivot tables has somehow put me into a automatic no-buy) - For [reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fmRyW4BdAPUOo74dn9x2d7lEi-dD2CmqHFd7Xo3Lj_Q/edit?usp=sharing), this is a copy of my many-paged stockchecker - looks complex, but here's an explanation. Feel free to copy.

I have only included products I have had for the past year, excepting the wishlist.

**Tab: Current**

The aims of this are:

- to serve as the data for the pivot table, which will tell me exactly what how many things of each type I own. It's also a record of whether the I would buy the product again.

- a behavioural aspect. This is the record of where I buy products from, when I bought them and whether there was a sale on or not. As it turns out, and somewhat unsurprisingly, I'm lazy (buy from Jolse), vulnerable to sales (as evidenced by the sale column), but somewhat good at using things up (date of purchase). Also, I don't end up duplicating things.

**Tab: Finished**

In here are the products which I have finished. The aim would be to get this filled up, especially with the things I think no longer work, rather than use up the the stuff I like quickly, so I have to restock. Again, another behavioural aspect.

**Tab: Pivot table**

This tells me how much of each type of product I have bought - dear god, I have too many moisturisers! But this is the most useful table, as it tells you what you may need to restock, but equally, what you just simply don't need more of (ahem, sheet masks)^1.

**Tab: Wishlist**
Although this looks similar to the 'Current' tab, there are some crucial differences:

- The number refers to the number of items that I have saved to that store's wishlist

- The price and subsequent conversion into a currency that I can understand (which is GBP). Google Sheets has a nifty little function which allows you to see the price of 'x' according to the exchange rate of today - which means that you can take advantage of currency fluctuations. YMMV of course, as PayPal and/or your bank may use a slightly different currency conversion rate. Click on a cell to see the formula that I use.

- shipping type, so that you don't forget about *that* cost too.

- total price of wishlist is mainly to remind me that this all has an actual cost

- and try not to duplicate things (failing a little at this, given two types of kelp sheet masks).

**Tab: Sheet 2**

This is the sheet which carries the data for all the drop-down boxes. Necessary, but dull!

The knock on effect of this has been that since I now know what I have, rather than just have a vague idea of what I have. I can keep track of what I like, what I would repurchase, what I don't want to repurchase, and remove things from my wishlist which are either duplicates of each other, or have remained on the wishlist for so long, I forgot why I put them there in the first place.

1. I actually have more than 15, more like 48, but for the purposes of clarity, this visible spreadsheet is only for things I have bought since Jan 2015. My actual spreadsheet is a whole lot bigger.

tl;dr: I haven't bought anything asian beauty related since the end of Feb 2015 because of my irrational love of spreadsheets and pivot tables.

So, like I mentioned in the original post, I got a little carried away in Sephora yesterday....  

Is there anything here I should/can return?  I'm mainly interested in color correction, moisturizing, and sun protection; are there any Asian beauty products I should be considering instead???

Info from the original post: 
&gt; **Context**: I have, literally, only a BH cosmetics 88 shimmer pallet, a set of EcoTools eye brushes, a nearly expired tube of mascara, and a few really old lip products and pencil eyeliners; I am only just getting comfortable with the idea of makeup and skincare- I guess I was a little overwhelemed, and just decided to buy everything I could find in travel size from the ""What to Buy at Sephora"" list.
&gt; 
&gt; **Skin tone**: the person helping me at Sephora told me the ColorID was probably not correct, and felt that [Peter Thomas Roth
&gt; CC Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Complexion Corrector in Light](http://www.sephora.com/cc-cream-broad-spectrum-spf-30-complexion-corrector-P378194?skuId=1595503#pdp-reviews) matched me well 
&gt; 
&gt; **Skin type**: kind of combination? recovering dehydrated/dry, with tendencies for products to give my skin an oily feeling; acne-prone
&gt; 
&gt; **Budget**: I reaaallly overspent on this haul.  The cheaper, the better - as long as no quality is lost.  I'm going to Japan mid-late April, and I kinda need to be saving what I can - I just didn't want to look so bad in all the photos!
&gt; 
&gt; **Makeup Experience**: Total noob.  I have basic knowledge of skincare and makeup; I know the difference between a primer and a foundation, for example, but not how to make a smokey eye not look like a black eye.  I do have a few tools: eyelash curler, eyelash comb, EcoTools travel eye brush set, a lipstick brush, and a ""natural foundation 111"" Sephora brush
&gt; 
&gt; **Special considerations**: I have had really bad acne, but it seems to be getting better with the super basic skincare routine I started with help from r/skincareaddiction and r/asianbeauty.

tineykitty,"[UK] A guide to the logistics process, or 'Dude, Where's My Sheet Masks?' - I've seen a few posts with the theme of 'where's my order :(' and thought I'd write a general guide as to why there may be delays in shipping your haul. Hope this helps!

**Introduction**

Although ordering is as simple as clicking a button, delivery (even in this world of next-day delivery/on-demand) is still a multi-step process, of which any of those steps could present with a delay. Below is an explanation of where there may be delays, from a rather UK-centric POV, mainly because this is my experience. YMMV of course, but apart from where there's obviously UK only references (like the paying of Parcelforce, and other things) the basic stages should be the same.

In short, after you hit the 'buy' button, this happens:

- The order is received by the shop

- The shop gets it sent from a warehouse

- This is then packed ready for delivery^1

- This is then delivered to the point of departure

- It is then approved for transit (often by plane)

- It arrives in the destination country

- It then goes through sorting in Heathrow (often called GBLALA, or the [Heathrow Worldwide Distribution Centre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Worldwide_Distribution_Centre)), where things like VAT and Parcelforce charges are determined

- You are then notified of any VAT/charges at this point - and your parcel is held until you pony up the cash. Or, if it is determined that you don't need to pay these things...

- It moves from GBLALA to being handled by the local handling service (in the UK, this will be either Parcelforce or Royal Mail, unless you are ordering via different means, at which point, it could be another local or international courier company). Remember, GBLALA is a HUGE place^2.

- If you are in, or are lucky enough to have a nice receptionist at work who will sign things for you, you then get your package. If not...

- You will get a slip through the door apologising that they couldn't reach you on the day of delivery, and to come to the nearest local sorting office (this will be on the slip) 24-48 hours after you get the 'Sorry we missed you!' slip

- Then you get your package!

As you can see, there are so many steps involved that it is a wonder than any package arrives anywhere in any semblance of a timely fashion. Here are a few pointers on common reasons for package delays.

**Pre-order**

The choice of delivery is crucial. Although [I have written about how EMS may not be essential in a separate guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/importing), you may find that the balance of impatience means that the monetary cost of getting it over sooner is absolutely worth it.

If you choose standard delivery - give yourself a month. If you're buying on Ebay, read the estimate delivery times - they're usually a good guide as to when things might arrive. YesStyle often has a 'ships in x days' which may inform your choices over whether you want it now, or can wait. If you are using Amazon Prime - check when they will deliver by. Sometimes it may be Prime, but not the next day. When it is the next day, it may not be until 9pm the next day.

**Supply**

Sometimes, shops don't know when they're out of stock, perhaps because it's flying off the shelves so fast that they can't keep up with knowing where all the stock is, or they just haven't updated the website. 

Certain times of year are more prone to this, and not the times that you may think of. Christmas is a good example of this, as is the Lunar New Year. Be prepared for backlogs as shops try to keep up, which may last for months after the event. Check what is a public holiday in the country which you are buying from.

**Manpower**

People fill, pack and send these boxes, and if they're not there - i.e. in key public holiday seasons, then this will add days to your delivery. Worker disputes and strikes will also add delays. People generally don't work weekends.

**Packing**

It takes a little skill to pack something into a small box, and this also takes time. The shop doesn't want you to pay more than necessary, otherwise you may not buy from them again.

Jolse packs its boxes like it opens up a 4th dimension of space, which obviously requires skill and some patience. GMarket has two packing phases - just before domestic delivery, and again before international delivery - take this into account if you've ordered from them, the 'packing' stage can get lengthy.

**Logistics**

The actual shipping from A-&gt;B is more than just the flight to the destination country - it's the goods getting from the warehouse, having the correct documentation, getting the package to the international distribution centre etc etc.

Again, times of high shipping load^3 (pre-certain public holidays, Winter sales) will impact on this. Hopefully, the logistics company will take this into account and plan for this, however, as this is not an ideal world, expect to add on weeks at certain times of the year.

Other things that impact on logistics are the 'Acts of God'. Natural disasters, or industrial disasters will impact on delivery of your goods. Industrial action will also impact on delivery.


**Local handler**

If the package is being held at GBLALA pending you paying VAT/charges, then they can hold it for a set number of days before you pay up, before sending it back. The answer to prevent delays here, is to pay quickly.

If your delivery is missed, and you have the 'Sorry we missed you!' card, then don't go earlier than the time recommended to wait on the card - your package needs to be re-scanned into the depot. When you do collect it, have photo ID and the 'Sorry we missed you!' card, with tracking number optional.

Your local handler may choose to leave it with a neighbour or, less likely, on your front porch. Whilst this may not present itself with a problem imminently, if you have neighbours who are not wholly trustworthy, or your porch is in an area vulnerable to theft, you may have a lost package. 

1. If you go via GMarket, this would be 'domestic delivery' Add another step - it gets packed again and delivered to a central warehouse.

2. [100,000 square metres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Worldwide_Distribution_Centre) apparently. 

3. More than 600000 separate packages a day pre-christmas, [2011 figures](http://postandparcel.info/44441/news/markets/uks-outbound-parcel-volumes-jump-thanks-to-cross-border-e-commerce/). Your sheet mask haul [will be one of them](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/uK9o-lGH7VE/hqdefault.jpg).

pygmy-puff,"I want to buy some products for my mom... can you help me, please? :) - Hello there! My mom has recently been interested in trying some asian beauty/skincare products. She has tried my Tony Moly Appletox products (the green and the red apple) and LOVED them, both the way they made her face feel and the packaging.  
  
She is 55 (almost 56) and has pretty great skin: no wrinkles (she wears sun screen religiously), normal (slightly oily) skin, not sensitive, no black or whiteheads but she has some enlarged pores. She loves cute packaging (tony moly) so that would be a huge plus.  
  
I'm considering getting her a few starter products to see if her skin likes asian products as much as mine. I don't have much money, so for now I want to get as few products as possible.  
  
I am getting her Bior√©'s sun screen (the watery one, sorry, I am terrible with product names and I am on the phone, so I can't check them), as my skin loves it, Tony Moly's appletox, and I was thinking about getting her a toner, a konjac sponge and a cleanser.

SnowWhiteandthePear,"PSA: Update to Blogger Guidelines and Rules - ##What's changing:

Over the last 6 months, we have seen an increase in the number of bloggers and blog posts on the sub.  **Bloggers have always been an important part of the community** and very much welcome on the sub (from the first days of its inception) **and that is not going to change.**

However, based off the reporting and feedback we have received, we realize we need to adjust the Blogger Rules and Guidelines to bring things back into balance.

As a general note, we will continue to firmly enforce the 10% ratio rule of reddit; no more than 10% of your contributions should be promoting your own content.  That means that you must be, first and foremost, a genuine participating member of the community who  *happens to also be* a blogger.  

In the past, this 10% rule was enough, but based off the feedback we have been receiving lately (**and once again a shout out to all those who mod mail us or report threads, thank you for making your voices heard!**), we realize that it‚Äôs time to also limit the quantity of posts beyond just the 10%.

So, based off feedback, we are going to start with a limit of ***no more than two blog posts per week*** as a starting number, with the disclaimer that we will be re-assessing this number in the future if needed.  

****

##FAQ:

&gt;**But I have so many wonderful things that I want to post about!  Reviews and Knowledge and Hauls, OH MY!  I have enough content to post every day!**

The limit will be 2x per week, but we suggest that if you have multiple links that you want to post, you could do a ‚Äòdigest‚Äô style text post with links to your content from the time of your last post to this one.  This way, multiple days‚Äô worth of blogposts are linked within a single thread submission, and people can click through the links in that single thread‚Äôs OP to read all your content from those days.

&gt;**How strictly is this rule going to be enforced?**  

We are adults here, and if it‚Äôs determined that someone cannot practice self-restraint and follow the rules, then like any violation: warning, suspension, and eventually ban.  This community is a *community*, not a ‚Ä¶ hunting ground for web traffic.

&gt;**I think this person is spamming the sub.  Why are they being allowed to get away with this?**

Honestly?  Probably because 1. we have not noticed (we‚Äôre human, after all) and/or 2. no one has reported it.  Please report it *with a reason given* or send us a mod mail.  We promise we will look into it.

&gt;**Do Giveaways/Hauls/PSAs/Cat Pics count?**

Is it content from your Blog/Tumblr/Instagram/FB/Twitter/Social Media/Site? (Basically anything outside of Imgur?)  If the answer is yes, then yes, it counts.  2x a week, max.  Do not spam. 

&gt;**But Moooooommmm!!!!**

NO! 2x a week max!

&gt;**When does the Rules and Guidelines take effect?**

Immediately, going forward; it will not be applied retroactively.

&gt;**What if it‚Äôs not my site, it‚Äôs just an external link to someone else‚Äôs site?**

Provided that you are not affiliated with them in any way, the existing general external link requirement of a comment explaining relevance to the sub will be fine.  If we later discover that you are secretly shilling for someone: (‡≤†_‡≤†)œà Shills shall experience the wrath of /u/MissPicklesMeow (^She ^says ^her ^favorite ^pitchfork ^is ^this ^one; ^-----¬ß ^as ^this ^one ^""spins ^like ^a ^saw, ^shredding ^OP ^to ^bits!"")

&gt; **So does this mean as long as I stick to the 2x a week, I don‚Äôt have to worry about the 10% rule?**  

No, you still need to abide by the overall rule of not being a spammy traffic vampire (‡≤†_‡≤†)œà  (^Even ^if ^you ^*are* ^a ^sparkly ^vampire ^due ^to ^your ^incredible ^Vit ^C ^glow ^and ^magically ^luminous ^Cushion ^finish, ^the ^answer ^is ^still ^no.)

smskin,"Review: Comparison of Secret Key Sweet Glam Tint Glow versus Missha the Style Glow Tint Balm - First off, I'd like to apologize for the low quality photos and my backlog of reviews due! But this came to me today because I wanted to a really good comparison of both products and which one is a better product. 

So first off, [here are the 3 versions of Secret Key's Sweet Glam Tint Glow Lip Balm](http://imgur.com/a/EgwU3#8dybQEL).  They're presented in the following order: Juicy Orange, Baby Pink and Fuschia Purple. Because I wanted to compare like with like, I compared the Baby Pink Shade to Missha's PK01. If you look [here](http://imgur.com/a/EgwU3#WMIWIq9), they are the same color in the tube so I thought it was the best way to do the comparison. 

First thing I did was to use Missha's version. I cleaned my lips thoroughly with makeup remover to be sure there were no other stains left. After applying Missha's balm, my lips looked like they did in the topmost photo [here](http://imgur.com/a/EgwU3#FdlQclF). They didn't change color and it was more of a clear gloss than anything. 

The second two photos are my lips after applying Secret Key's balm. Immediately, the very light pinkish color started turning into a darker pink shade that didn't resemble the color in the bullet. The same thing happened with Juicy Orange version but the Fuschia Purple ran true. 

Verdict: Overall, for moisture, I'd go with the Missha product because it was more emollient and it's provided lasting moisture. However, the Secret Key Glam Glow balms are fun to have around just for the novelty and they all end as nice wearable shades -- but you still need to use a thicker balm underneath to get lasting moisture. 

TL;DR: Missha for Moisture and shine, Secret Key for Color. Better yet, use both where you layer them. Both brands feature good balms but I'm still working my way through the Secret Key Balms because what you see in the tube is really not what you get, as opposed to the Missha version. So Missha wins this but only slightly.",2042,350,asian_beauty

SnowWhiteandthePear,"Fluent in Chinese, Korean, or Japanese? We need your help! - As we continue to grow, our community is getting more and more Asian businesses visiting us, contacting us, and in some unfortunate cases, spamming us.  

Considering the significant interest in Asia in breaking into the US market, and the ever-rising popularity of Asian Beauty products in the west, it makes sense that we are seeing more and more of this direct interaction from companies.  

However, it also seems **some things are getting lost in translation** ... such as the rules governing how businesses interact with the community.

***

From the **Rules and Guidelines** ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/index)):

&gt;8.All business related posts (this includes market research) MUST be submitted to the moderators for review prior to posting. (e.g. ""I opened my own store"", ""I am thinking of opening my own store, etc)

&gt;9.Businesses participating in the community must identify themselves with a business flair; any businesses (or representatives serving and promoting a business' interests) posing and posting as regular users without identifying themselves with a business flair (this will be done via contacting the mods through mod mail) will be considered deliberately attempting to mislead the community and will be dealt with appropriately.

***

So while discussing the latest snafu (from a major brand, no less!) we realized that **it would be very helpful for us to have the rules also posted in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese**.  To that end, we are reaching out to the community for assistance in translating the subreddit‚Äôs Rules and Guidelines so our favourite vendors, brands, etc, who are looking to interact with can do so within the guidelines.  

However, since we don‚Äôt speak said languages, we don‚Äôt want to mislead businesses that communications with the Mods should not continue to be in English.  (The thought of trying to explain the line between participation and self-promotion with only Google Translate is enough to make one break into a cold sweat!)   It would help if we had a translated statement that ‚Äúall communications with the Moderators must be in English‚Äù since regretfully we cannot do otherwise.

I love it because it is super pigmented and stays on even without a primer. however because I am a jobless student (;_;) with monolids (meaning I have to use A LOT of liner) $20 can kinda be pricy for me. Do you guys know any liquid liners that are similar to the Stila liner? Can be western or AB.

Skin feels tight and NOT hydrated :( - Last year I bought the Recovery Gel and used it as a light moisturiser under heavier creams and it felt like it enhanced the moisturising properties of the following cream.

Couple ofweeks ago I ordered my 2nd round of the Recovery Gel AND the All In One Cream because I thought together it would be the ultimate moisture kick - but it somehow isn¬¥t :(

When I apply the both products it feels good at first but after 5 minutes my skin is tight and the product completely ""gone"" (or sinked in).

It is in Chinese so basically the guy was saying that you should always cleanse your face after using a mask. If you do not cleanse your face after using your mask, the ingredients from the mask left on your face will have an opposite effect and reabsorb the moisture from your face, making it dry.

I don't know if this is true or not, because sometimes when I don't wash  the serum off my face, my face did feel dry after a while. That is why I looked up how to use a mask and stumbled upon this video.

**my skin type**: dry-combo, sensitive, problematic, sometimes dehydrated.

**quick review**: since the name of the line is ‚Äúroyal honey‚Äù i assume that the effects i‚Äôm meant to see are a) youthful glow and b) moisturising.

i tried the toner first by itself and i thought hmm not too bad. didn‚Äôt break me out or anything. got rid of dead skin cells. not too fragranced. the toner is watery and i use it with my fingers.

the emulsion (lotion) is hard to get out of that small sample container but the emulsion doesn‚Äôt feel very thick. it‚Äôs light on my skin and not sticky. didn‚Äôt break me out.

when i use both toner and emulsion, i do notice my skin looking a lot more glowy (in a really nice way!!). i was really surprised n_n not sure if it‚Äôs a combination of other factors but whenever i use it, my skin always has this healthy glow. 

it does what it says (although, fyi, it is summer where i am so i‚Äôm not sure how the moisturising part would hold up in winter) and like most of skinfood‚Äôs products, it isn‚Äôt too expensive. would purchase if in korea

sneakymama,"Product recommendations for ultra-sensitive skin? - I'm super-late to this Asian Beauty products game.  I've been living in Korea for about 9 years and am on my way out and want to start a skin routine.  I have used various Korean brands over the years, but got very hesitant to try anything new after having a few bad reactions to whatever it was that I was using (even those little face masks that are like $.50)... now I'm on my way out and I'd like to get some product.  

So since I'm starting from scratch in literally every step of the skincare routine, what are some good product recommendations?  As I mentioned, I have very very sensitive skin.  It's combination, I would say...dry patches around my eyes and cheeks and sometimes the side of my nose, but an oily T-zone.  I'm fortunate that I don't get a lot of breakouts.  I have a lot of sun damage, but I'm wary to use sunblock or BB cream because most that I've tried give me red stinging bumps on my cheeks.  I know that this is a must, so if there are any recommendations for that, I would love it.  (I've been using a tinted moisturizer with SPF called Physician's Formula, but if I use it every day, it irritates my skin.)

I really love the idea of the Skinfood and Innisfree product lines, but I've not been successful in finding something that doesn't give me hurt-y flare-ups.  I also did a search in this group and found that Benton, LaNeige and Hada Labo have been successful for people with dry sensitive skin.  But maybe one line has a great essence, while another has a good cleansing oil.

I'd like to know if any of you had any experiences with SYN-AKE products or other products that had a beneficial effect for you.

Thank you :)",575,106,asian_beauty

retsun,"Looking for ingredient lists but can't find them on Cosdna or in English? Try this. - This morning I found [All of Cosmetics](http://www.allofcosmetics.com/), which looks like a Korean version of Cosdna. It lists the ingredients in **both Korean and English** (cue golf clap). I use Chrome's translate page function to help me navigate around because I don't know a word of Korean, but the search bar on the front page will help you find things.

The website is a little finicky but it's a lot faster than translating from scratch. There's also more stuff than what Cosdna has, especially makeup.

**A few possibly-helpful things I've noticed** (especially if you're completely Korean-illiterate like me.)

* You can *generally* search for English brand names (ex. Etude House, rather than ÏóêÎõ∞ÎìúÌïòÏö∞Ïä§, Skinfood, LJH, etc).
* Some entries have the product image to help you find what you need, if you're lucky.
* If you're looking for something specific, try going to the brand's official Korean website (or anywhere that has the Korean name) and copy &amp; paste the product name to search.
* For those without product images, you could always [Google the name](http://i.imgur.com/NbQosuH.jpg). Usually you can figure it out from the images that come up. This one comes out to be Too Cool For School's Dual Cover BB Cream. :)
* The cute-but-annoying cat popup on every page will go away if you [sign up/in](http://www.allofcosmetics.com/auth/register). The boxes are username, email, password, password again.
* You can [paste Korean ingredients on this page](http://www.allofcosmetics.com/main/product_analytics_share), it will process/translate it for you and add it to their database. The three required fields are brand, product name, and ingredients. You can also add product photo and/or a picture of the ingredients, though not sure how well this would work. This is similar to [Cosdna's analyse page](http://cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php), if you've ever used it.

Any additional pointers from those fluent in Korean would also be very helpful!

I'm always in need of ingredient lists because my no-no ingredients are all rather common, so this is going to be really helpful if I want to try new things in the future. I hope this helps some of you here as well.

SnowWhiteandthePear,"Product and Routine Order FAQ - So let‚Äôs say that **you've read the [Asian Skincare 101: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide &amp; FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2jcss2/asian_skincare_101_a_beginners_guide_faq/)**, curated yourself a few hauls, lemming‚Äôd after a few delicious HGs, and now you find yourself swimming in product and a bit fuzzy on exactly what goes where. 

Or maybe you've moved up to an intermediate level and want to add in some Actives, such as Vitamin C ([FAQ here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/)), BHA, or AHA.  Or all of the above.


You've read the **basic product order from the Beginner‚Äôs Guide**:

&gt; The Basic Steps

&gt;When complete, your Asian skincare routine will be in this order, though you may not necessarily have every step:
&gt; 
&gt;    * Emulsifying oil cleanser
&gt;    * Foaming, milk, gel, powder, or soaping cleanser
&gt;    * Chemical exfoliator(s) and/or toner
&gt;    * Essence, serums and ampoules
&gt;    * Emulsion
&gt;    * Lotion
&gt;    * Cream
&gt;    * Facial oils
&gt;    * Sunscreen
&gt;     

But if you‚Äôre staring at your essences, lotions, milks, serums, ampoules, gels, creams, and oils and going cross-eyed, then this post is for you!

##Resources:

There are some really great resources out there for the core steps, such as /u/mrsaufziehvogel post on colorcrrush.com's ""[**The Big Korean Skincare Beginner Orientation Post**](http://www.colorcrrush.com/2015/03/the-big-korean-skincare-beginner.html)"", and /u/picoprince‚Äôs adorable and informative [**visual quick guide**](http://picoprince.com/post/92276170731), ideal for printing and posting on your mirror, or so we've been told. ;)

If you are looking for a guide on **how to put pH-dependent products in the right order and adding them to your routine, such as Vitamin C, BHA, or AHA**, you can check out ""[**Putting your products in order, including pH dependent acids**](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2015/01/skincare-discovery-putting-your.html)"" which covers not only what order, but why.

.
***
.
##FAQs:

.
&gt; **I have XYZ products, what order do I put them in?**

Since you are the most familiar with the product, as you researched and purchased it, you‚Äôre actually the best equipped to answer this question, trust us!  Have faith in yourself, you can totally do this: all of the above resources use the general guideline of thinnest-to-thickest, so you need to check the product information where you purchased it on what the purpose is, and most importantly examine the consistency of your product.  

You may find that your ‚Äòemulsion‚Äô is actually thicker and more rich than your serum, you may want to reconsider the order and try putting the serum on first.  Thinnest to thickest, watery to oily.  Keep that in mind, and you can figure out any product in your lineup!

.
&gt; **But what about Actives?  I hear they have a special order**.

True, they are an exception.  See the [guide on putting pH dependent products in order](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2015/01/skincare-discovery-putting-your.html) into an Asian routine. 
.
&gt; **When I look at the website, it says I should be putting XYZ product first, but I use ABC product and I thought that goes first?**

Is ABC product an Active?  If so, refer to the pH dependent order guide linked above.  If it‚Äôs not, follow the ""thinnest-to-thickest"" and ""watery-to-oily"" guidelines.

.
&gt; **Why do some toners go before Actives, and some after?**

Because there are two kinds of toners, the **pH adjusting kind, and the hydrating kind**.   The pH adjusting kind is to restore the pH of your skin after cleansing (see ""[Why the pH of Your Cleanser Matters](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2014/09/skincare-discovery-why-ph-of-your.html)"" for more on the impact of pH on your skin) and the hydrating kind should be considered as another layer in your skincare.  If you‚Äôre not sure which yours is, the pH adjusting kind need to have a pH of 5.5 or lower (preferably under 4.5), and the hydrating kind will have terms like: hydration, moisture, water, rich, nourish, etc. in the description.

.
&gt; **There are so many things that go last, what is really supposed to be ‚Äòlast‚Äô?**

Yeah this can get confusing because of day vs night.  

* AM routine: last step in skincare is sunscreen.  
If you don‚Äôt wear makeup, your AM routine ends here.  If you do wear makeup, you carry on from there.

* PM routine: the last step is either a sleeping mask/pack (if you use one) or a spot treatment (if you use one).  
Depending on your spot treatment, you can either layer it under the sleeping pack (sleeping pack last) like [picoprince recommends](http://picoprince.com/post/92276170731), or if your spot treatment will be negatively affected by laying product over it (drying lotions, acid spot treatments, or hydrocolloid bandanges may have issues with getting ‚Äòwet‚Äô) and/or you‚Äôre having issues applying the layers around/avoiding the treated spots, you can layer everything as usual and then carefully clean off just the area you want to treat. 

.
&gt; **I have product that seems like it should go later but honestly I feel like it works better when I put it head of XYZ step?**

If it‚Äôs not an active or pH dependent, and it‚Äôs working for you, rules be damned.  You know your skin best.   Play around with the order if you feel like some of your products are really more suited to a different layer in your routine, because if it works for you, do it!

.
&gt; **What product should I use for XYZ step?**

Every season we have a **Holy Grail and Honorable Mentions recommendation thread** on the sidebar so you can check out people‚Äôs favourites for each step in their routines, if you‚Äôre looking for a recommendation.  
***
We also have the **Daily Routine Help &amp; Troubleshooting, ELI5, and Questions stickied in the subreddit each day**, so if you've worked your way through all the resources and still don‚Äôt have the answer you need, pop in and ask!

I can't believe how hydrated and wonderful my skin felt after that sheet mask! 

I have been looking at AB for awhile now, but never really tried anything until yesterday. I am now convinced that I must convert! 

I just have a few questions about starting a routine and what would be best for my skin. I have dry and dehydrated skin that looks kind of dull. I have also been getting acne lately, but I figured out that it is a result of going off birth control... so I am back on birth control to help with the acne issue. My current routine is just using vaseline because my skin is just not happy right now and I am not sure what to try.

So I was thinking about ordering a couple things to start:

- Mizon Returning Starfish Cream
- Mizon Snail Intensive Ampoule 

I already have Hada labo hyaluronic acid lotion, and it is pretty good at moisturizing my face. I also have Paula's Choice 2% BHA and Paula's Choice 8% AHA.

Does anyone have any recommendations? Are these products a good introduction into an AB skincare routine? 

Can anyone recommend a moisturizing cleanser? I tried Cerave hydrating cleanser but it broke me out, as did cerave in the tub.

I've tried both Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cushion and Innisfree Ampoule Intense Cushion and I'm having the same results. Amazing application, glow and moisture which my dry skin needs, but poor wear and dramatic creasing throughout the day. I notice both cushions crease immediately - especially around my upper eye and laugh lines. I'm caucasian, and have defined eye creases, but I've never experienced creasing and fading like this!

My favorites previously were Missha Perfect Cover (ashy and drying), Holika Holika Moisture Petit BB Cream (great finish and wear but too dark), and Urban Decay Naked Skin Liquid Makeup (my favorite, but expensive, smells weird and needs to be applied carefully). Maybe I should just have a dedicated product for the ""high traffic"" areas and use a cushion for the flat surfaces of my face? Ugh - so high maintenance.

ecologista,"Move over snails. 2014 is the Year of the Starfish (Extract). - There are a number of positive reviews on the ***Mizon Returning Starfish Cream*** knocking about and it has been getting a pretty good reputation lately - and a lot of questions about Starfish Extract. I've done a bit of research!

Will you regenerate the face of a 15-year old? Maybe not. Could it be useful in preventing/slowing PIH, treating acne and inflammations?  Here‚Äôs a basic primer (or... maybe a little more then basic) on the ingredient and some interesting studies that support its use in cosmetics and potential benefits.


**The basics**

&gt; A starfish is a star-shaped marine invertebrate belonging to the class [Asteroidea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish). They (typically) have 5 arms and they vary in size and habitat. Of interest to us, most starfish are capable of regenerating arms and legs from the central disc (potentially dropped in times of stress). Some have the ability to regenerate a new disc (that's right. a new body) from a removed arm. The idea that they have such amazing regenerative abilities has spawned an interest in starfish for cosmetic and drug use. No, not really expecting you to regenerate limbs - but using starfish to aid in the regeneration of skin cells (cell turnover)!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *The* starfish cream you may have heard about lately is Mizon‚Äôs Returning Starfish Cream (&amp; Eye Cream variation) which claims to contain 70% starfish extract. Mizon advertises it as having repairing, firming and water-trapping properties. Get it? Returning starfish? Like‚Ä¶ [returning limbs](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wargandproud/59739744/109832/109832_600.gif) ?!


**Potential Benefits of Starfish Extract**

&gt; Starfish extract (which is powdered, and then re-constituted using enzymes, water, or methanol) is very stable (even at high temperatures) and can be used at a range of pHs [6].
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Starfish extracts have anti-microbial effects when tested for fungi and yeast growth - this may be due to the steroidal compounds they contain. This effect may also be interpreted as anti-tumor as the same study observed extracts showed some effects on slowing tumor cell growth [6]. These steroidal compounds may be generated by the starfish to deter predators from feeding on them [1][6].
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; One study by Jeong et al. tested the melanin production of mushroom cells when starfish extracts (from A. pectinifera) were applied; they found that powdered starfish extract may ‚Äúcontain potential skin-whitening materials that could induce reduction of melanogenesis in melan-a cells by reduction of tyrosinase activity [4]‚Äù. The conclusion of the study was that starfish extracts may slow the process [[melanogenesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte#Melanogenesis) - cell production of melanin, which pigments skin cells] that causes hyperpigmentation, and may be a promising cosmetic additive.
&gt; 
&gt; Another study using the same starfish extract tested it‚Äôs anti-inflammatory ability and found that it ‚Äúdemonstrated a strong anti-inflammatory effect through its ability to reduce NO production and it also inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines [1]‚Äù. 
&gt; 
&gt; On a different species of starfish, P. regulus, one study evaluated the starfish extract on wound healing capabilities (on guinea pigs) and found that wounds treated with the starfish extract healed faster, and that P. regulus extracts have potential wound-healing abilities [5].

**Ok, so‚Ä¶ where do they get these starfish?**

&gt; Mizon does not identify *which species of starfish* are used in their cream; however, studies have been done on both Asterina pectinifera (blue bat star) and Pentaceraster regulus (Spotted Seastar). Both A. pectinfera and P. regulus are starfish commonly found in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. 
&gt; 	
&gt; Starfish are opportunistic eaters that are often carnivorous - in South Korea, they are common pests that are capable of causing damages to shellfish farms along the coast [2][1]. Starfish can regenerate quickly and reproduce both sexually and asexually, and are quite prolific in these areas. As a result they are often collected and exterminated for pest control - for this reason it‚Äôs also possible A. amurensis (a starfish that is highly invasive and also found in and around Korea and Japan) is used in cosmetics [2]. In fact, there are dedicated starfish-collecting methods, one of which is the the [mop method, which is awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HHDAJSvh9E) [3].
&gt; 
&gt; This is quite interesting as it seems like starfish are systematically exterminated and disposed of each year as pests - potentially using them in cosmetics or drugs is actually useful ecologically but economically as well.

**Starfish Extract - What Even Is**

&gt; Warning: This will be a little (a lot?) NSFL - if you have issues with animal products (why are you considering a starfish cream) or are a bit squeamish, you can skip this section. *The non-gross TL;DR: we don‚Äôt know exactly what‚Äôs in a cream, though based on studies using starfish extract, it is likely powdered.*
&gt; 
&gt; For studies that have looked at starfish extract, the extract is obtained in generally the same process; they are captured and left to dry out. At that point they are either blended dry into a powder or reconstituted with methanol and blended. The resulting powder or blended mush is pH adjusted, enzymes may be added, and then filtered, perhaps numerous times. The most popular, and most effective, methods appear to be dissolving the powdered starfish in enzymes or methanol concentrations.
&gt; 
&gt; You may be wondering *what exactly* that contains. Starfish, like other members of the echioderm phyla, are very simple organisms without the complex organs you might expect. They mostly consist of a tube radiating from the center, and some guts stuff that [looks really ~~awesome~~ gross](http://wwwbio200.nsm.buffalo.edu/labs/tutor/Starfish/Starfish29D.jpg). Basically, starfish are mostly mush. Starfish extract - with the methods described in the literature cited - is likely composed of proteins and other constituents of starfish mush.



Have I convinced you? Keep in mind that cosmetics would promise you the moon if you'd buy the product, but it certainly seems like a promising cosmetic additive. Let me know if you have questions/qualms; as always read on through the citations if you'd like to explore more in-depth. 

**Edit**: /u/iirteoo has included some great information in the comments about the difference between hydrolyzed extracts and the ones commonly discussed in these papers! [Rest assured, it is highly unlikely there will be methanol involved in the starfish extracts for cosmetic use](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2ilph5/move_over_snails_2014_is_the_year_of_the_starfish/cl4awyy).

cat_hawk,"[Review] The Face Shop Seaweeds Moisturizing Pack - Hey guys! I'm new to this sub, so I thought I'd introduce myself with a review. I haven't seen much talk about this pack, so here it goes!

My skin: I have combination skin (a few dry patches and oily around the T-zone) and acne prone. I just started using Differin and Spironolactone (I only mention this because it might be the reason that I'm not breaking out with this new product).

Why this product?: Honestly, I was in The Face Shop at Herald Square a few days ago and couldn't wait for my TesterKorea box to arrive!

The Review: So, it has only been a few days, but I really like this pack. I have no means of comparison, though, as I've never used one before. But, from what I've gathered from other posts, this pack is very light. It absorbs quickly (which is good for me because I sleep on my side). It has a very light, almost citrus-y fragrance. Not at all overpowering. After patch testing and a few uses, it hasn't made me break out (see above if this is a concern of yours). So far, my skin is softer and brighter. Since winter is coming, I will probably look for something heavier, but for now, I am happy with this purchase!

Edit: Forgot to ask, does anyone have any recommendation for other sleeping packs for acne prone skin? Thanks!

tl;dr- Seaweeds Moisturizing Lotion is light, fresh and works well with my acne-prone skin. Probably not thick enough for winter.",1437,262,asian_beauty

NotReallyAnon,"Just moved to Hong Kong and need some help - Hi everyone,
I apologize in advance if this comes off as pathetic.

I recently moved to Hong Kong and have been hit with a fair amount of culture shock and homesickness. Usually when I have problems of this kind I help myself with some makeup retail therapy!

The problem with this at the moment is when I walk into a Sasa or Bonjour I get so overwhelmed that I can't focus enough to look around - so I'm requesting ANY help you guys could give me about asian products I could potentially buy here so I can walk into these places with a purpose.

I am looking to change my skin routine as well.

Basically I'm looking for recommendations for the following:

**Skincare:** 

* Vitamin C Serum (Or anything else that may help) - I have freckles/dark spots I'd love to try to fade
* AHA + BHA: At the moment I'm using the Hada Labo Tamagohada AHA+BHA wash as a cleanser but since it just sits on the skin for under a minute I doubt that has any real effect other than cleaning.
* Any other things you'd like to suggest!

I have combo skin, not prone to acne but I do have sun damage/freckles. (Yes, I bought a decent sunscreen, they're everywhere here!)

**Makeup:**

* A Primer - Currently I use Hourglass mineral primer or Illamasqua Matte Veil although I'm running out of both.
* Long lasting lipstick - I don't know if I'm missing something but I can't seem to find ANY lipstick. I keep accidentally buying lipglosses. Usually I use the Revlon Ultimate Liquid Lipsticks but they don't seem to sell them here.
* The obligatory pale skin foundation/BB cream - I can't find Colorstay in Ivory here. I do love and have tried Missha #13, but any other suggestions would be appreciated.
* A finishing powder - Preferably in white. ""Translucent"" powders with a tint are usually too dark for me.

Buying online is not really an option for me - I live in a new building and apparently it ""Doesn't exist"" when parcels are trying to be delivered. I'd rather avoid the hassle it takes to find and retrieve packages.

Any other help or suggestions you can give me would be greatly appreciated - anything would be a great help! If you've been to Hong Kong and can suggest any areas for me to go and look (Even for western brands I can't find here over in Kowloon) I'd appreciate that too.

Thank you in advance!

pinay53,"Annie's Way Arbutin + Hyaluronic Acid Brighting Jelly Mask is awesome! - I first heard about this mask from a bubzbeauty video a while back and a few weeks ago I saw that yesstyle had a sale on it so I splurged.  This mask has hundreds of reviews on yesstyle, but I've never really seen it mentioned much here.  It's a pretty unique mask in that it's a clear jelly which you apply in a thick layer, then scrape off with a spatula and rinse with water.  Anyways, I've used the mask about 3 times and it's amazinggg!  I remember reading that this mask supposedly pulls out blackheads, but I took that with a grain of salt especially since clay masks have never had that kind of effect on me.  Now I don't have blackheads, but I do have a couple of closed comedones and this mask seriously helped to pull them out of my pores!  Some grits along with dead skin flakes were floating around in the jelly I scraped while other grits were literally sticking halfway out of my pores ready to fall out (a bit gross sounding, but quite satisfying lol).  Not only was this jelly mask an awesome magnet for grits, it made my skin feel sooo soft and smooth!  I've only used it about once a week so I can't say much about it lightening my PIH, but my skin definitely looks much brighter right after I wash it off.  Just a bit of advice, if you do decide to try this mask it really is important that you put a decently thick layer or else it'll dry up and you won't be able to scrape it off.  Anyways I definitely recommend this mask to you guys and I hope someone else loves it as much as I do! :)

dino_friends,"Moisturizing right away vs applying chemical exfoliants - Hi /r/AsianBeauty! I've been planning on adding AHA and BHA treatments to my routine to help rid my acne and I've seen that it's recommended to apply these products right after cleansing and waiting 20-30 minutes before continuing.

But then it's also recommended to moisturize your face right away after cleansing, and some people go so far as not to dry off their face after rinsing and applying toner while their face is still a little damp. Supposedly the first few minutes right after you wash your face is the most important and if you don't moisturize in that time it becomes damaged.

So if you were to not only not moisturize, but to apply dehydrating chemical exfoliants and to wait 20+ minutes after that, wouldn't you be allowing your skin become damaged?

After using a harsh foaming cleanser a handful of times, my skin became leathery, pseudo-wrinkled and gross. It's mostly healed now but it seems my skin has also transitioned from being oily to normal-dry since I passed my teens and I'm anxious to protect my moisture barrier.

I'd like some advice on how to handle this part of the routine and maybe some product recommendations. Thank you!",1218,208,asian_beauty

I wanted to create a sort of overview for Chinese brands for those of us living in China that don't want to pay the super high VAT on Japanese/Korean brands but also don't have time to run to HK.  I also think Chinese brands are starting to gain the trust of local consumers, which is a good thing for the industry as a whole.

For issues about quality, I think the best thing one can do is to avoid less known brands, buy from better stores like Watsons, Sephora, or Sasa, and if you have to buy online, use tmall instead of taobao.

Sharkus_Reincarnus,"Asian Skincare 101: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide &amp; FAQ - So you‚Äôre interested in Asian skincare, but you don‚Äôt know where to begin.

##The Philosophy 

There is a lot of buzz around the concept of Asian skincare, and a lot of confusion. Most articles about it focus on the high number of possible steps that an Asian skincare routine can contain, which can be overwhelming for newcomers. 

The Western skincare routine is comparatively simple. It boils down to cleanser and moisturizer. Some people use eye cream and some have a spot treatment. Serums are usually a splurge. Taken individually, each of these products can be great. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to solve all of your skin problems with just one cream and nearly impossible to develop and manufacture a cream to suit every possible combination of skin problems. What if you're struggling with acne and aging? What if you're aging but oily? What if you want to fade dark marks while hydrating very dry skin? Good luck finding a single product that tackles all of these problems while still being at a formulation that works for your skin. Some active ingredients need to be within a specific pH range to work. Others simply don't play well with each other.

This is where the Asian skincare routine comes in. You know all those toners and essences and serums and ampoules and emulsions you keep hearing about? They act as a vehicle of delivery for different active ingredients to target different issues or to reinforce the treatment of issues. You might have a toner or essence that brightens, with a serum that targets aging, and an emulsion and cream that address redness. The possibilities are endless. That's what makes Asian skincare so effective for so many of us!
***
##The Basic Steps
When complete, your Asian skincare routine will be in this order, though you may not necessarily have every step:

* Emulsifying oil cleanser
* Foaming, milk, gel, powder, or soaping cleanser
* Chemical exfoliator(s) and/or toner
* Essence, serums and ampoules
* Emulsion
* Lotion
* Cream
* Facial oils
* Sunscreen

***
##How to build an Asian skincare routine
When it comes to building an Asian skincare routine, there are many different approaches you can take. You can wait until you run out of one of your current Western products, then look for an Asian replacement. The other, which I advocate, is to prioritize your product replacements based on two things: importance and rarity. First look for products that are important to skin health and for which it is difficult to find high quality equivalents in the mainstream Western market. The products below are arranged in that order. And while you're building your daily routine, try out some sheet masks! The instant gratification they offer can't be beat. This is why sheet masks are known as the Gateway Drug to Asian Skincare‚Ñ¢.

**Note: To prevent irritation and breakouts, remember to patch test every new product and give yourself 2 weeks to 1 month in between introducing each new product; otherwise you won‚Äôt know which product had which effect - positive or negative!**

##Sunscreen
When it comes to protecting  your skin from dark spots, signs of aging, and cancer, sunscreen is the most vital component of your routine. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Western drugstore sunscreens are unpleasant to use, especially at the ¬º Tsp dose that's recommended for full coverage. They tend to be heavy and greasy, with a strong white cast. The Asian market offers a huge selection of affordable, cosmetically elegant sunscreens with high UVA and UVB protection. Start here. For effective protection, look for a sunscreen with high SPF and PA Ratings: at least SPF 30 and PA+++ or higher.
##Cleansing oil/makeup remover
Now that you have a good sunscreen, you'll need an effective way to remove it at night, as well as to remove any other makeup you wear. The [double cleanse](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2014/08/skincare-discovery-cleansing-part-i.html) is an integral part of many people's Asian skincare routine. The oil cleansing step breaks up and lifts off sunscreen and makeup so that your foaming cleanser can wash it away and get your skin nice and clean.
##Essences, serums, and ampoules
Now it's time for the really fun stuff! Essences, serums, and ampoules will be the primary vehicles for your skincare actives--the ingredients with specific, measurable effects against specific skin troubles--and thus the primary method by which you can customize your skincare routine. They are also where you can really start playing around with interesting ingredients that you won't find at the drugstore.

Essences are usually a watery liquid. Serums and ampoules are thicker and contain more concentrated active ingredients. All types generally deliver some light hydration but are meant to sink in to the skin underneath moisturizing products.

**Here are some popular ingredients and their functions:**

* Vitamin C: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, repairs sun damage, increases collagen production over time.
* Niacinimide: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, strengthens skin's moisture barrier
* Snail secretion filtrate/snail mucin/snail goo: Alleviates redness, treats pimples, speeds healing, repairs sun damage, evens skin tone. [Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23652894)
* Arbutin: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots by blocking the expression of melanin with long term use.
* Yeast ferment extract/galactomyces/saccharomyces: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, evens skin tone, controls cell turnover and oiliness
* Hyaluronic acid/Sodium hyaluronate: Hydrates by attracting and binding water within the skin
* Glycerin: Hydrates by attracting and binding water within the skin
* Salicylic acid: Chemical exfoliant (BHA) for the clearing of pores and treatment of acne; anti-inflammatory. Requires a pH between 3 and 4 to be effective.
* Glycolic acid: (a type of AHA) Chemical exfoliant for the smoothing of skin's surface and treatment of acne; hydrating. Requires a pH between 3 and 4 to be effective.
* Hydroquinone: Lightens dark spots. A controversial ingredient, hydroquinone--commonly associated with ‚Äúskin bleaching‚Äù products--is rarely offered in over-the-counter products, except in extremely low concentrations, and you won‚Äôt encounter it much in popular Asian skincare lines. Hydroquinone works by inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase by acting as melanocyte cytotoxic inhibitor and by increasing the cytotoxicity of melanocytes.  Arbutin is a gentler and much more common cousin of hydroquinone. 
* Kojic Acid: Also lightens dark spots. Kojic acid lightens the skin by suppressing tyrosiase activity and is commonly used in topical formulations to treat dark spots. Kojic acid has a higher efficacy than arbutin in lightening the skin. (source: Skin Lightening and Depigmenting Agents : Article by Alaina James) 
* Mandelic acid (a type of AHA), a popular option for those who react poorly to the more common AHA options.
* Starfish extract: Could starfish be the new snail? The preliminary research is promising, showing starfish‚Äôs anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, whitening, and wound healing potential. [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2ilph5/move_over_snails_2014_is_the_year_of_the_starfish/) 

Don't feel constrained to use only one of each product type at a time. If you have multiple issues to treat, using multiple essences, serums, or ampoules is absolutely acceptable. Just remember to use any pH-dependent products first, and wait around 20-30 minutes before adding more products on top. And don't feel required to use all of these product types if you don't want to. An Asian skincare routine is only as elaborate as you want it to be!
##Moisturizers
The Asian skincare routine offers several options for moisturization  and hydration. Emulsions are thin, liquid lotions that generally provide light hydration. They may be all that an oily skin type needs, while dry skin types often find them useful to add an extra boost under a heavier cream. Creams are thicker and generally more moisturizing. Sleeping packs and sleeping masks are heavier still and serve as the occlusive last step in a normal or dry skin type's nighttime routine. Facial oils can also be used as an occlusive last step, which is particularly helpful for very dry skin, and can also be blended with creams. As with essences, serums, and ampoules, all of these moisturizing options can include different actives to care for different skin problems. Also like essences, serums, and ampoules, you don‚Äôt need to use them all if you don't want or need to!
##Toners
It can be difficult to find a Western equivalent to the Asian toner. In Western markets, toners are often astringent and meant to dry up oily skin types, which is usually a no-no in the nurturing Asian skincare philosophy. In contrast, Asian toners are typically hydrating, exist to remove residue, or lower the pH of skin after an alkaline cleanser so that it is more balanced and is ready for acids if you use them, and in general ‚Äúarrange‚Äù the skin after cleansing so that it is ready to receive the optimal benefits from the products that follow. Some contain actives, while others focus on hydration by providing ingredients like hyaluronic acid. Look for one at a pH of 5.5 or below.
##Other products: Foaming cleansers and chemical exfoliants
When putting together an Asian beauty routine, I generally find it most practical to deal with products like foaming cleansers and chemical exfoliants last. This is because there are perfectly acceptable options for these available in the Western market. For cleansers, look for a [pH](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2014/09/skincare-discovery-why-ph-of-your.html) around 4 to 5.5.  Our [cleanser pH spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-NtG1u1bp9h83YC2XDfa8Q-XgLB_b_kPi8c9sQW50co/edit#gid=0) can be a good starting point. For chemical exfoliants, look for a pH between 3 and 4. Some other products also have specific pH ranges where they work best, such as Vitamin C, which you can read about in more depth [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/).
And that's about it! If you so choose, there are also a number of clay masks, face scrubs, and other special-occasion options to add in to your routine for an extra oomph.
##A note on samples
Everyone's skin is different, making building an Asian skincare routine a process of trial and error. You might think this makes the endeavor prohibitively expensive‚Äîand it would be, if you had to purchase full sizes of every product you want to test. Luckily, Korean skincare companies make samples very accessible. Online vendors like TesterKorea and RoseRoseShop sell sample sets and packs of sample sachets for a few dollars each and are often generous with samples when you make purchases. In addition, some people, like me, have built up large collections of samples over time and might just be willing to share them, if you ask nicely.

##Beginner FAQs

**There are too many steps!  Do I have to start with a full routine to see benefits?**

No, as I mentioned above in **How to build an Asian skincare routine**, you can start slowly by replacing your western products with Asian ones as you empty them, although sunscreen (especially if you don‚Äôt have one or don‚Äôt like the one you have) is always a good starting point.

**Snails and starfish?  Hell no, I‚Äôm noping right outta here.**

They‚Äôre popular for a reason, but there are many, many popular Asian products that have no ""unusual"" ingredients that you can‚Äôt also find in western products, although the Asian formulations are often better and at a lower price point.

**I tried one of the cult products and it broke me out!**

Sadly, not everything works the same on everyone.  Many things you just need to explore for yourself, which is why patch testing and staggered introduction of new things is so important.  You can also look at the ingredients on [cosdna](http://cosdna.com/) to start narrowing down what ingredients don‚Äôt work for you, so you can avoid them in the future.

**Ok I‚Äôm sold, I‚Äôm ready to buy X product on amazon/ebay.**  

Beware of fakes.  You can review the Giant List of Sellers from the sidebar link [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/290to0/giant_list_of_websites_ebayers_etc/) for trusted sellers.

**I keep seeing ""whitening"" everywhere- I don‚Äôt wanna bleach my face!**

Rest assured, whitening **usually** refers to ""brightening"" by fading areas darkened by damage.  It will not change your natural skin tone.

**Show me the science!  Studies  and sources for everything,  or GTFO.**

One of the great things about the skincare market in Asia is that the consumers are highly discerning, have almost zero brand loyalty, and are always looking for ‚Äúthe next best thing.‚Äù  This creates a demand for fast and progressive Research &amp; Development, so companies can release new products and woo customers away from other brands.  This means there‚Äôs always something new and exciting being researched, but peer-reviewed studies are a slow and methodical process.  Also, companies want to protect their intellectual property so data is not always immediately released.  There are preliminary studies out there such those linked earlier for snail mucin and starfish extract, which is exciting, but you‚Äôre not going to get the same ‚Äúestablished proof over 20 years of study‚Äù like you are with western ingredients.  That‚Äôs part of the fun!

**How do I choose  products?**

We can only give you pointers. Ultimately, the person who needs to do the research is you.  Figuring out your skin type and what concerns you have you want your routine to help with is a good first step.  You can get an indicator user flair [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2hb3k9/new_feature_update_indicator_flairs_now_available/) which will tell people what your skin type and troubles are, so they can make informed recommendations.  We also have many product resources on the sidebar, so you can look through them for people who have the same skin type and troubles as you.  Researching what works and doesn‚Äôt work for your ‚Äúskin twins‚Äù is a great place to start!  

If you have already looked through the sidebar recommendations and you‚Äôre still lost, go ahead and post a thread. [Here‚Äôs a quick guide on how to ask for help](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/askhelp) so you can include the kind of information we need to help you better!

In the original post, give us as much detail as you can: your skin type, age, climate, what you want your products to do for you, what your skin troubles are, ingredients you know you react to, what you are currently using and what you do and don‚Äôt like about your products, what country you are in, and what your budget is.

ricepatty,"[Review] Banila Co. Clean It Zero Purity Cleansing Balm - I must admit, I bought this without giving it a lot of thought, as this was before I really began to do a lot of skincare and Asian beauty research.  But boy am I glad I did!  It‚Äôs also the first time I‚Äôve ever used a cleansing balm and aside from pictures and descriptions, I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect!  So let's get to it!!

---
##**Packaging:**


I really wish I took a picture of this thing before I started using it because it was so pretty!  Here‚Äôs what it looks like now after about a month of use:  http://imgur.com/defsUXI and  http://imgur.com/dTm3jSt


Even though it comes in tub form, it provides a little spatula to keep it sanitized.  As you can see, I like to spatula only one side so I can still have a section that is un-touched and extremely smooth looking!! 

---
##**Application:**


I use this as the first cleanser in my double-cleanse routine at night, and the MRCS as my second.  The directions say to massage this product onto your face and then tissue it off.  I actually didn‚Äôt know these were the directions when I started using it so I always just washed it off instead of tissue-ing it off and it‚Äôs worked for me.  I only found out about the actual instructions later after reading skinandtonic‚Äôs review of the original lol.  I imagine tissue-ing it off would help with make-up removal immensely, but I haven‚Äôt tried (or needed to).

---
##**Smell:**


This cleanser doesn‚Äôt have any added fragrance (yay for you peeps with this sensitivity!), but it does have a faint, fresh floral scent.  I personally like it a lot!

---
##**Performance/Results:**


Overall, this is one of my top cleansers; the Su:m37 MRCS is #1, and this is #2.  Compared to my old Shiseido White Lucent Cleansing Foam (which had a pH of 9.5, yikes!!), this cleansing balm is AMAZING.  It makes my face feel extremely soft and smooth after cleansing and I don‚Äôt get that dry, squeaky, tight feeling that I used to get with the Shiseido cleanser.  I think it might actually be slightly more moisturizing than the MRCS!  I have really dry skin in general, so this was a huge plus.  It also doesn‚Äôt leave behind any greasy residue like some cleansing oils or OCM can.  Finally, if you get it in your eyes, it doesn‚Äôt sting but it does blur your vision for a few minutes (I imagine this is because of the oil residue?).  It‚Äôs not really a problem for me, since I can wash it off after a few tries or I just use my MCRS right afterwards and it takes care of that issue.


As a make-up remover, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty good.  You may need a dedicated make-up remover for those really hard to remove make up though (I‚Äôm looking at you Kiss Me Mascara).

---
##**Ingredients:**


This is kind of the main reason I LOVE this cleanser so much!  It has a pretty damn rockstar ingredients list.  The full list can be found here: http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_4575161484.html 


I‚Äôve included an analysis of some of the ingredients below.  It‚Äôs a massive wall of text, but the TL;DR is that they‚Äôre all pretty great. 


- *Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride:* This is the triglyceride fraction from coconut and is not the entire coconut oil, so it should be less comedogenic than straight-up coconut oil.  Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride has also been shown to be a non-irritating and non-sensitizing solvent, is an acceptable vehicle for topical applications [1], and is just a great overall moisturizer.  Additionally, it‚Äôs anti-inflammatory properties may actually reduce the risk of breakouts.  Finally, it has some occlusive properties to help resist water loss!


- *Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan oil):* I don‚Äôt really need to go into this much, everyone knows about the moisturizing benefits of argan oil! It‚Äôs also got some medicinal uses against rheumatism and the healing of burns apparently.


- *Oenothera Biennis Oil (evening primrose oil):* Evening primrose oil is rich in fatty acids, including linoleic (LA), oleic, and y-linolenic acids (GLA), that help repair the skin and improve the skin‚Äôs barrier function.  These fatty acids also have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, acne reducing and moisture retention properties!  However, it appears that evening primrose oil‚Äôs stabilizing effect on the stratum corneum barrier works only with a water-in-oil emulsion formulation (which I believe Banila Co. Clean It Zero Purity is, phew!) [2]. It also looks like it has some anti-irritant properties as well [3], so I have no idea why cosdna gives it an irritant rating of 2.  I imagine the anti-inflammatory properties should also make it more likely to help prevent acne instead of causing it, and LA is also supposedly very beneficial for acne-prone skin.  So again, not sure why cosdna rates it as 2 on acne.  Those that are acne prone, please let me know if evening primrose oil breaks you out.


- *Portulaca oleracea extract (a type of succulent):* Seems to have wound healing properties [4], muscle relaxant properties [5], and analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. 


- *Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (Licorice root):* I think it‚Äôs pretty widely accepted that licorice root is an awesome active for skincare purposes.  It‚Äôs got anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and brightening properties!


- *Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (green tea):* Antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties!  Please note that most research seems to agree that green tea has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties while applied topically; however, I‚Äôm not sure that the anti-carcinogenic properties are really that effective when used topically (compared to drinking it!).  There does seem to be some research that shows green tea extract can also prevent collagen breakdown and reduce UV damage to your skin [7 &amp; 8].  


- *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract:* Who doesn‚Äôt love aloe?


- *Beta-Carotene:* good antioxidant/helps protect against sun damage [9 &amp; 10], but this benefit is dose dependent!  Too much can actually generate oxidative damage (e.g. cell and tissue damage) [11].  I‚Äôm going to assume that because this is rather far down the ingredients list that it‚Äôs probably within the optimal amount to be beneficial.


The rest of the ingredients all look pretty solid, but I only had time to do a quick search on them. I don‚Äôt really see any ‚Äúbad‚Äù ingredients.  Sources will be provided in comments since this post is already huge.

##**Overall Summary:**



Pros:

- gentle and FAN-Freaking-TASTIC ingredients (unless you‚Äôre actually allergic to one or more of them‚Ä¶)

- non-stripping

- non-greasy

- moisturizing 

- not messy 


Cons:

- a little pricey

- I can‚Äôt figure out the pH of this thing because I don‚Äôt think pH strips work for this mostly oil based cleanser.  But that‚Äôs not really the fault of the cleanser‚Ä¶

samplehime,"You Need to Report Benton to the FDA - **The thread for Benton infection pictures is [here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2dzknd/benton_breakout_picture_thread/).**

*Update: this thread was deleted from /r/skincareaddiction by a moderator claiming we have no evidence. It's our pictures, gram stains, and anecdotes versus Benton's email. I am not going to tell you what to believe, but I'd like to think our skin speaks volumes compared to a few emails from a company trying to save their ass. The claim that we have refused to provide lot numbers is false. Many people broke out from using sample vials that did not come with manufacturing dates. The common link between full and sample bottles is that they were purchased from a batch sent to RRS in late 2013 or early 2014. I can provide the lot number of one bottle that is definitely contaminated when I retrieve the bottle sent to me by another affected person (because it's currently sitting in a biohazard bag at work.) My bottle was thrown out during my couple thousand mile move the week after my outbreak started. I assumed my skin would get better after I stopped using the toner and I was wrong. Benton asked that if I can't send them the original bottle that broke ME specifically out not to bother sending any. We have not made any refusals to comply with Benton. Benton has been lying in a PR attempt to save what little faith people have in their company.*
  
I wanted to post a quick update of what's going on with the Benton problems now that I've hit a wall. Here's what happened: I talked to *the* supervisor about the toner and got permission to culture the toner. Well, I brought two toners into the lab and had them plated on basically everything you would need to recover the bacteria from a wound or skin infection. When I came in the next day I was told there was bad news--said supervisor decided to change her mind (what I was told is likely because of the possibility of liability after she found out to what severity this infection has caused on my face and other people's). Even though it was already plated (in other words, money wasted) she threw the plates away before they got to 24 hours growth. Minimally that could've told us what might be on the plates based on colony appearance, hemolysis, which plates it grew on, etc. 

I emailed my school to see if I could call in a favor and was told that if the infection/symptoms are this bad, they also cannot take the liability of culturing whatever is in the bottles, especially if my lab is afraid to do it. Even though my school's lab is a BSL2 like any other hospital, my professors instructed me to contact the CDC or FDA. I told the instructor that this product was not made in the US, nor is it confined to people in the US, and she still insisted that this be reported minimally to your local CDC because they may want to take action and culture the bottles themselves, especially because this product is being sold around the states and even by some companies within the US. Most state labs have a BSL3 (bio safety level 3) which means they can handle more dangerous bacteria. 

If you have been affected by Benton's products I am urging you to report your reactions to the FDA using [this](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/index.cfm) form, and please be extremely detailed of your symptoms and when you purchased your bottles, etc. I am not going to risk my job and culture these bottles if permission has been rescinded, and I do find it quite worrisome that even my most adventurous instructor isn't willing to take this risk after hearing about how many people it affected (to put into perspective, this instructor cut a botfly out of her own arm to preserve for a class). 

I have been using two types of topical antibiotics for the past 3 weeks and I have seen literally no change in my skin quality. I want to know what contaminated these bottles and I think everyone else who was infected also deserves to know. **Benton asked me not to reveal what I found in the bottles, and this to me is even more distressing.** If it helps on your form, I did see some bacteria and what looked like fungi growing in the bottles I gram stained and looked at in a urine slide. There is definitely something in there. 

Please please report your infections to your local health agencies, even if you are not from the US.

bluedlink,"[Advice] Looking for a BB cream for oily skin without SPF - I'm someone who doesn't wear makeup normally, however I'm trying to learn a bit more so I can bust it out for special occasions. I started using Etude House Cotton Fit BB Cream and it worked out okay for me. I will be helping out at an event where I would like to wear a bit of BB cream, but I don't want to use the Cotton Fit because it has SPF and I will probably have to pose for some photos.



I searched around a bit and I found two BB creams that sorta fit my needs but not quite:



Lioele Beyond the Solution - No SPF, but it's too light for me. I'm pretty warm and tan, not quite olive but noticeably darker than more one-shade BB creams.



Fairy Drops Candy Bar BB Cream - No SPF, but I'm still weary. The darker shade is still a bit light for me. Looks to have so-so reviews. On top of that, a few reviews mention a heavy smell which I really don't want. Doesn't seem to help with oily skin either.



So basically I'm looking for:

* Something that'll suit a tan complexion

* No SPF

* Good for oily skin

* Won't irritate my skin (I'm super acne prone)

* No scent or a very light scent

* Won't look terrible if I sweat a bit- it'll be overcrowded and stuffy and I sweat way too easily.



Am I searching for something that doesn't exist? I appreciate any advice you can offer, but at this point I'm feeling like this is a no go. I'll probably try the Fairy Drops one if nothing else comes up, but I'm not feeling too good about it.


EDIT: Just found out about The Face Shop Quick and Clean Oil-free BB Cream. Seems a bit more promising than the other two, but it's another one of those one-shade BB creams, which pretty much always end up being too light for me. Has anyone with a tan complexion used this? Yay/nay?",1794,350,asian_beauty

That's how I knew what to drop from my routine, and I hoped that this would help others. 

As of the 13th September 2014, Benton has officially responded about the [**Aloe Toner**](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2g3sqq/benton_official_statement_test_results_aloe_toner/) but not about other batches of the Essence. That being said, /u/valentinedoux posted a really [**informative post**](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/2f6cdg/concerned_about_safety_about_benton_products_we/ck6dt8j) about the preservatives they use. **It is likely that the reactions we had were entirely due to the breakdown of preservatives due to heat in transit, or in storage and not any form of contamination.** So, to be on the safe side, keep your products away from direct sunlight and refrigerated if possible. Always double check your products, and patch test all the things!

epipin,"Looking for a first treatment essence for dry skin - Hi everyone! I'm new here - I just joined last night from /r/skincareaddiction. I have a somewhat Asian-inspired routine and have been thinking of adding a ""first treatment"" essence type product and also probably an extra serum.  

I've been eyeing Missha's First Treatment Essence, but then I saw that on /u/skinandtonic's blog, she said she likes Su:m37¬∫'s Secret Programming Essence better for dry skin. But...it's a little spendy for my budget, and I'm a bit wary to buy Korean products off eBay, to be honest, since the whole Benton contamination thing. I know this isn't Benton, but I'd feel more comfortable with a brand that is directly selling products in the US. Missha I know has a US site, so I assume they must be in some way complying with some US regulations somewhere or other. I recently saw that Fresh has launched their [Black Tea Age-Delay Instant Infusion Toner](http://www.sephora.com/black-tea-age-delay-instant-infusion-treatment-toner-P384777). It looks like it would have a lower concentration of ferment filtrate, but more of the soothing ingredients that I already know and love, so it could be a good choice. It is more expensive than the Missha though.  

Anyway, what are your guys thoughts on first treatment essences? For dry skin in particular. Does this Fresh product look good, or should I just buy the Missha already and stop overthinking it.

Here's my whole routine in case anyone needs it. Skin type is mature, sensitive, and dry. I get product breakouts but not exactly sure what from - typically occlusives and the heavier silicones seem to be an issue. I definitely get redness if there's too much citrus extract going on in a product too. Main problems I'm trying to address are hyperpigmentation/melasma, redness, and trying to keep the wrinkles at bay. 

**AM**  
Oily Cleanser - Earth Science creamy fruit oil cleanser (formerly known as A-D-E cleanser). pH 5.5  
Hydrating Toner - Thayer's Rose Witch Hazel. This doesn't do anything as far as I can tell - would swap this for an essence.  
Vitamin C serum - Mad Hippie OR Andalou Naturals Turmeric + C.

I am concerned that one of them is a fake, because the ebay stick has [a less deeply embossed pattern on the top](http://i.imgur.com/R6YmLeg.jpg), the colour of the tube is a slightly lighter pink (you can see this is in the above image), and the [images in directions on the back are in slightly thinner lines/lighter](http://i.imgur.com/C7G9Gby.jpg).  (Ebay stick is on the left, Avecko stick is on the right in both of the above pictures, also the embossing is more defined on the right stick although the picture makes it hard to tell.)

I can't really tell if the contents are the same as [one has been in use for a few weeks vs the other which is completely dry.](http://i.imgur.com/bpp4Wwo.jpg)  I did think when I got the Avecko stick that the insides were more purple than other images online, but I also saw some that were a similar lilac shade so I chalked it up to differences in lighting. (Avecko stick is on the left, ebay stick is on the right)

The box came fairly battered as it was in a plastic padded envelope with gobs of bubble wrap inside it, not a stiff-sided box, so it no doubt had a rough trip here. Otherwise, the two boxes are as identical as I can determine.  Now I'm scared to use either, because I have no way of knowing if the 1st was a fake and the 2nd is real, or vice versa. :\

hatstretcher,"[REV] TonyMoly Shiny Foot (Holy crap) (NSFL) (DISGUSTING photos ahead proceed with CAUTION) - Hello. About a month ago I saw someone post their results from the TonyMoly Shiny Foot feet mask and decided I needed to give it a whirl. I ordered it off Amazon and had it in my hands 2 days later. Here is my foot tale.

(pictures at bottom) 

I normally have pretty ""rough"" feet around the heel and the ball because I wear sandals pretty religiously from May-September and I walk a lot. I have every product known to man to keep my feet ""good enough"" or as smooth as I possibly can. I have dealt with cracks and splits- in all stages. I regularly exfoliate, pumice, file, and moisturize and it helps for a couple days but needs to be done religiously paired with no sandals :( to show any progress. Recently I've started having my regular pedicurist add an enzyme scrub + paraffin dip to my monthly routine and it helped a bit too.

Nothing could prepare me for what would actually happen when I decided to soak my feet in two plastic bags full of acid. Nothing. I will tell you this: I had a pedicure with enzyme scrub, full callus file and paraffin dip just *two weeks* before I tried TonyMoly. My feet weren't THAT bad, though, they have had these deep split/cracks in the heel and ball for the entirety of the Summer (which are still there but much less noticeable and also not as deep).

I decided to do a little research before I did the mask, which I'll admit, I was scared to do. I did a small test patch on the top of my foot but couldn't wait any longer and put the bags on and filled 'em up. I watched 3 episodes of SVU for a total of about 2 hours and then waddled to the bathtub to wash off the chemicals. It smelled weird, real strong, but I wasn't afraid. My feet felt very heavy afterwards and were pruney. That was that.

The following week I waited and anticipated my feet to come off in sheets, but, nothing happened. Everyone said it would take 7 days and by the 7th day I had barely noticed any peeling at all (just a little between my toes) and decided the product actually didn't work. A couple days later I noticed more peeling around the softer parts of my feet (GREAT) and the tops and the toes and thought it was only working on the very top layers of skin and couldn't penetrate the deeper, harsher calluses. I also noticed the bottoms of my feet were REALLY rough and even though I spent some time with the pumice in the shower, nothing could make them smooth down so I was disappointed, annoyed, and at this point kinda mad that the product had made my feet *worse*.

And then something happened. I went swimming and when I went to wash off, I noticed my feet were really gross. Super gross. The grossest thing ever. And I noticed patches were peeling off and it was actually starting to work. I was so excited and (TMI) couldn't keep my hands off my feet, I wanted it to just happen in one sheet but that wasn't the case.

Skin. Everywhere. The next week (day 10-day 17) was horrifying, disgusting, satisfying, incredible, disgusting. I began to wear sneakers/flats/boots instead of sandals because I had a bad case of what my husband has been calling ""Zombie Feet"" and didn't want anyone to judge me. I started soaking my feet in the bathtub and in a small tub for 30 or so minutes a night and ""helping"" the skin along by slowly massaging it.

Day after day my feet kept getting cleaner, smoother. Until tonight when I took my final foot bath and nearly ALL the dead skin was gone, along with the cracked heels and roughness I've grown accustomed to. I even tested it out by rubbing my feet across a blanket that has always snagged my feet and it did nothing.

What is left of my feet are smooth, soft, new pink skin. Of course my heels are drier than most other places and the deep deep cracks/cuts are still there, though all very near the surface and very healed. In short, my feet have been renewed. 

I have spent hundreds of dollars on products trying to cure this foot thing. I drink a gallon+ of water a day, get regular pedicures, spend tons of time trying to take care of my feet and this is literally the only thing that has worked, aside from 6+ months in socks with lotion, and it worked in 2 weeks.

I'm so excited to be able to share this disgusting but exciting review and though I am super embarrassed by the disgusting photos, I'm excited to continue to take excellent care of my feet and use this product a couple times a year to keep them looking and feeling their best.

And as a side note, no part of this process hurt in the slightest even though it seemed like it should!

pestilentflesh,"[Question] Extreme dry skin around my nose? - I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but I'm looking for product recommendations for the extreme dry skin I've had around my nose for the last couple of months.

A little bit about my skin - I have combination normal/oily skin, so typically my nose is pretty oily. Up until the past couple of months, at least. Basically, I had a pretty bad head cold and I usually get a sore nose and dry skin which typically disappears within a week or so of me being better. But not this time, the skin around my nose got so dry that it started to crack and bleed where my nose joins the rest of my face. 

I've been using a gentle physical exfoliant once or twice a week along with a paraffin based moistuizer twice a day, and it has helped a lot but my nose (especially around my nose piercings and where my nose joins the rest of my face) still feels uncomfortably dry, tight, and rough. Also, if I'm in a rush or forget to use my moisturiser, visible flakes of dry skin will have formed by the end of the day.

Again, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this, but I'm reaching the end of my tether and have no idea how to deal with this:(",1196,233,asian_beauty

I don't have rosacea, my skin just gets very red. My skin type is truly normal, neither oily nor dry, however I usually treat it as dry skin because moisturizing products tend to help with the redness.

i went on my lunch break to get some 'mother daughter spa day' stuff and for being such a small space they have a really good selection from a broad range of brands!

they had about 5 or 6 of the most highly recommended sunscreens that i see on here all the time for at or around ebay price, a bunch of hada labo stuff, a good selection of eyeliner/mascara, a TON of lioele stuff, a lot of products from the innisfree volcanic line, some from the apple line as well. they also had a small selection of etude house stuff, they had a few items form the collagen line. there was a rack with a ton of beauty supplies/tools (i got a foam net!), and cute nicknacks. also, testers!!! testers everywhere!! and so many masks! and a bunch of stuff i'm forgetting!

they had SO MUCH STUFF that i see raved about here all the time, and some other stuff too that i have to check out. the prices aren't that bad, either! it's mostly comparable to ebay prices, maybe a dollar or two more but for being able to test it out and having it in my hands that same day, a dollar or two extra per item isn't too bad!

the sales associate was also SUPER NICE! we had just been in the nature republic store and the ladies there were eyeballing us like we were some sort of criminals, but the lady in 0035mm was a sweetheart!

they also have a rewards/email program thing you can sign up for and they'll send you information about sales, and you get 10% off during your birthday month!

Also, has anyone tried the Shiseido Anessa line other than the Perfect UV, specifically the mild version or bb cream? - I've been using Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV for months and it's the best compromise between greasy and too drying I've found so far, but being the skincare junkie I am, I'm convinced there's something better out there. 

What I'm looking for: 

* physical/chemical mix - physicals are always too greasy, full-on chemicals are irritating :( 

* dries to a matte finish

* preferably doesn't grease up during the day (every sunscreen I've ever tried does this, even the alcohol-laden ones! Aghhhh! Does anyone know why??!) 

* I'm not averse to alcohol, but I'd prefer it to be on the bottom of the ingredients list if possible

* no fragrance

* [edited] preferably PA++++

* wears well under bb cream! Because I am vain ;) 

* preferably cheaper than the Anessa line.... Because in addition to being vain, I'm also a cheapass. But price isn't an issue for perfection, so don't shy away from recommending higher-end stuff as well!

girl_misanthrope,"Apparently sheet masks are a gateway drug... - Ever since I've gotten into Asian skincare, my skin has been noticeably brighter and smoother. My mom has been commenting on how nice my skin looked, and I told her all about how awesome Asian skincare products are. I gave her one of my Benton snail/bee sheet masks to try out a few weeks ago, and she finally got around to using it. She called me today saying, ""So remember that mask you gave me? I really liked it! My skin felt really moisturized. So, ummm, can I have some more?"" It was super cute! I convinced her to let me buy some products (including more sheet masks) for her since the La Mer products that she's using aren't doing much. She says her skin feels really tight and dry during the day, and it's emphasizing her wrinkles (she's in her early 50s).

Here are some products I'm buying for her:

* Missha FTE and Ampoule 

* Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask

* PC 8% AHA Gel (not Asian but I figured it would be good for her)

* Sheet masks! (not sure which brand yet, probably Innisfree or MBD)

pinay53,"Missha Signature Compexion Coordinating BB Cream in Honey Beige is AMAZING (Missha 31 lovers try it out!) - So I just tried out the Missha Signature Compexsion Coordinating BB Cream in Honey Beige and I absolutely love it!  I'm about an NC 40 and the Missha 31 was my holy grail for the longest time.  As all of you tanner girls know, finding a BB that matches our shade can be almost impossible, which is why I'm super excited about this one!  Basically, this new BB is like an upgraded version of the Missha Perfect Cover #31.  The color is very similar except the Complexion Coordinating BB has a more neutral undertone instead of the slightly pinky one that the Perfect Cover has.  It actually matches my skin tone even better!  Another difference is that this BB doesn't have a strong fragrance like the Perfect Cover.  Personally I really liked the fragrance of Perfect Cover, but I know some people didn't and the Complexion Coordinating smells more like sunscreen.  I also feel like this BB has a lighter feel on my skin and a slightly more matte finish.  Coverage wise, I think they're about the same in that it can cover most of my acne scars.  Right now the only downfall is that it only comes in a 20ml tube while the Perfect Cover can come in a 50ml tube.  Hopefully they'll make a bigger one soon!  Tomorrow I have a longer day ahead of me so I'll test out how it lasts throughout!  (I know I probably should've waited until tomorrow to write a review, but I was too excited about a potentially new HG that I had to post now lol).

Edit: So I just tried it out for a whole day and good news...it still looks awesome!!  No sudden breakouts and my face isn't any oilier than usual.  On another note, there is a slight perfumey scent I didn't notice before, but it's definitely not as strong as the Perfect Cover.  Even though the colors are similar, I do feel like it matches my summer tan better.  Hopefully it'll still match me in the Winter!  I now officially consider this as one of my HG BB creams! :D

FeynmansBongos,"[HAUL] First Haul from W2Beauty and Amazon! - What I got:

* Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Benton Snail Be High Content Steam Cream
* Nature Republic Forest Garden Chamomile Stick Cleanser
* sum:37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick
* The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Light Oil 
* Etude House Baking Powder Pore Cleansing Foam
* Etude House Wonder Pore Freshener 10 in 1
* SkinFood Premium Tomato Whitening Emulsion
* TONYMOLY Red Appletox Honey Cream

I also got a couple sheet masks in the samples (and a collagen thing?). Can someone tell me how to use those/when to use them? I'm rather confused. Thanks!

So the stuff from W2Beauty and the sum:37 Rose Stick (bought from an Amazon seller) came relatively quickly (~2 weeks), but the stuff from Amazon seller A-Poly took FOREVER (~4.5 weeks). I'm a little sad that my Wonder Pore toner leaked some, but it's basically full, so no biggie. As I've had the stuff from W2Beauty longer, I can review the stuff for my bf. 

My bf has extremely dry, extremely sensitive skin. I've been trying to find stuff for him to use that hydrates and soothes his skin and doesn't sting/hurt. I had gotten samples of the Benton line (Aloe Toner, Aloe gel, Snail Bee essence, Snail Bee steam cream) that I tried on him and he said it really helped. However, he's lazy, so I only got full sizes of the aloe gel and steam cream. The Aloe gel is literally the best thing. He LOVES how it feels and he doesn't have to keep re-applying lotion all the time. The steam cream he is on the fence about, but he likes that it hydrates. For the Nature Republic cleanser, he liked that it left a slightly waxy feeling and didn't dry him out, but it started to irritate his skin after a couple weeks of use.

If you go down the main Chinatown road (Gerrard Street) in Soho and follow the curve, down Newport Court there are a few little shops there. One in particular had lots of stuff in the window and posters of Asian celebrities (Do Min Ju.. &lt;3).

Their prices are *extortionate*. ¬£3.99 for a single sheet mask, ¬£6.49 for a hydrogel mask. The lady who was there was also super rude, I couldn't touch anything without her sighing really deeply.

I felt super uncomfortable the whole time and I couldn't really browse. But I saw they had some BB creams and a few sets. Opposite it was another shop, but they mostly had Japanese stuff, and as I was looking for Korean products I didn't stay long. But they had some sunscreen and a lot of circle lenses.

ecologista,"Magical Color Change! Review &amp; Swatches~ - If you‚Äôve been around here for while, you‚Äôve probably seen me suggest or rave about the Tonymoly Crazy Cat Tint Stick ‚Äì it‚Äôs my absolute favorite lip product. Unfortunately, because it was part of the old Cat Chu Wink series, it seems to have been discontinued before I could even think to re-order myself another tube. :‚Äô(

Recently, I‚Äôve wanted to find a dupe though, and knowing that there‚Äôs a ton of ‚Äúmagic change‚Äù products, I decided to haul almost exclusively color change lip sticks in hopes I could find a dupe for my beloved blue kitty lipstick, and I‚Äôm here to share with you my results!



**First things first ‚Äì ‚Äúcolor change‚Äù claims vs. reality**

Color changing products have been around forever it seems, I remember being obsessed with ‚Äúmood lipsticks‚Äù as pre-teen in the 90‚Äôs and 00‚Äôs. They haven‚Äôt had too much of a renaissance in western makeup yet (though there are a few offerings ‚Äì most notably Dior‚Äôs Lip Glow), but within the world of Asian beauty almost every brand has a ‚Äúmagic tint‚Äù lipstick, gloss, or tint range.

Most of these claim that these magic bullets (pun intended) will change to YOUR PERFECT color that flawlessly matches your skin tone and your body chemistry. The primary color-change ingredient in these lip products is like Red 27 (CI 5410) [[1]](http://musicalhouses.blogspot.com/2013/09/an-ingredients-analysis-of-colour.html) [[2]](http://www.manrepeller.com/2013/05/henna-lips.html) otherwise known as D&amp;C [Red#27](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701793/D%26C_RED_27/). I say likely, because I can‚Äôt find any sort of ingredient list for anything I review here, but all the other color-change lip products list it as an ingredient.

If you are interested in a little more analysis of Red #27 and how the color change happens, I‚Äôve included it in a comment (so I don‚Äôt bore you terribly!) TL,DR: they don‚Äôt really have anything to do with your skintone or ‚Äúskin chemistry‚Äù [[4]](http://thebeautybrains.com/2011/05/27/can-cosmetics-really-change-color-to-match-your-skin/).



**Product list &amp; Reviews**

Today I‚Äôve got a review for you of 8 color-change lipsticks that start out in various colors and change to shades of pink or coral. They are, in order of appearance:

* Secret Key Secret Kiss Sweet Glam Tint Glow ‚Äì baby pink to pink
* A‚ÄôPIEU byeolbyeol tint stick ‚Äì Green to glittery mess
* It‚Äôs Skin Ice Creamy Lip Bar ‚Äì Apple Green to baby pink
* Peripera‚Äôs Peri‚Äôs Tint Jelly ‚Äì Yellow to coral
* Innisfree color change tint balm ‚Äì Yellow to coral
* The Saem Allys Ajell Magic Lip Stick ‚Äì blue to Pink Berry
* Tonymoly Crazy Cat Tint Stick ‚Äì blue to ‚Äúsky pink‚Äù
* Shara Shara Secret Magic Lip Stick ‚Äì purple to lavender purple

Sorry about the state of some of these ‚Äì I am not joking when I say I *adore* my Crazy Cat Tint, and it shows. I have loved the Shara Shara lipstick too much and it ended up breaking, so it is also not the most lovely thing to look at. :‚Äô( Also: I have Amazonian-warrior-princess-hairy arms. LOL.

The review of each, along with some swatches,  is contained in the album [HERE](http://imgur.com/a/9WAe6)!



**The bottom line**

I love my color-change lipsticks. I love my Crazy Cat Blue Kitty Magic Henshin Tint Stick, or whatever name it actually has. I still haven‚Äôt found a comparable dupe for it yet, though I have found a few others that I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd love ‚Äì and have completely fallen for. Maybe there‚Äôs something you‚Äôd like to try?
Do you have experience with other color-change lip products I haven‚Äôt listed here? Please suggest them to me! Alternatively, feel free to ask questions about any of the products I reviewed here!

hanatwothree,"Clio, Skinfood, Nature Republic Haul from Flushing, NY - I went to Flushing to see a friend and do some shopping. We didn't have time to go to Missha since it's pretty far from Main Street, but I did go to The Face Shop, Skinfood, Nature Republic, and Clio. I am the biggest cheapskate so I absolutely hate marked up prices at physical stores and would rather buy them off eBay and wait for a whole month on free/cheap shipping, but my friend offered to buy my biggest purchase (Nature Republic) so yay! Here's the [album](http://imgur.com/a/tDtgX). And here's the obnoxiously long I-hate-how-expensive-it-is toned haul description.


**Clio**

I originally went in to buy the pastel liner in Mint Ade but it was $22 which is a $10 markup than Korean retail price, so I opted to splurge on an eyeliner instead since I'd use it more often. I'm pretty sure the employee was side eyeing how much product I was wasting because I kept twisting out too much haha.. I know Clio's liners have a good rep and I haven't found any eyeliner that doesn't smudge on me, so I'm crossing my fingers. Con: The employee would NOT leave me alone. And I wanted Mint Ade but she kept trying to pushing the pink and lilac one on me instead like gurl stop. She was also one of those ""use a lighter foundation color to brighten up your face"" suggesters. Naw gurl naw.


**Skinfood**

The Skinfood shop just opened up on Friday. I went crazy testing out all the things! I love the smell of their grapefruit makeup fixing spray, so I might buy it later since my mum stole my NYX spray. The rice mask and black sugar mask were only marked up a few dollars from the Korean retail price, so I decided to get the rice mask. I already tried the black sugar mask which I fairly enjoyed, but my skin is too sensitive right now for that type of physical exfoliation. I just tried the rice mask today and it is really nice and hydrating! Pro: My total was $25 and they gave me a box of 3 black sugar sheet masks for free. FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111 If you live nearby, you should totally go check it out and try to snag one. They said they're opening more locations soon like in Chinatown and I think their main store will be in Ktown? Con: The rest of their products were ridiculously marked up.


**Nature Republic**

$12 for 80 makeup wipes? Awh yeah. I just hope they don't dry out too quickly. The fragrance in the watery cream is pretty strong, but I am loving this stuff. My mom already took it from me and stores it in her room u_u Mothers...  I just ran out of my aloe vera gel. I really like the way it feels on my body and hair. Never ever ever ever ever putting this on my face though. I knew it has alcohol in it, but I believed in the power of 92% aloe vera and ended up burning the shit out of the irritated parts around my eye. I was a fool. I think it'll make for a nice mist for the summer if I mix it with things and put it in a spray bottle. I've been itching to buy the Innisfree lip mousse, but alas, there are no Innisfree retail stores around here. I opted to buy the lip mousse here instead, which looks like it has the same texture as the Innisfree one. If anyone wants swatches + demo, let me know~ Pro: They had a good amount of items that weren't too marked up, especially their popular ones like the aloe vera gel and aqua cream. Con: Employees just follow you around. They're not very generous with samples either. My friend bought my things with her stuff and our total was $180. All we got were 4 packs of the 3 samples... If I were in Korea, it would have been raining free samples and gifts, yo. ):


**The Face Shop**

TOO. EXPENSIVE. Their sheet masks are 10 + 1 free for $20. Clio and Nature Republic had way better deals since they were like $10 or $15. It was very messy in that things weren't properly labeled or didn't have a price. I also think the employee thought I stole a lip scrub... I totally forgot to go back here to buy the strawberry lotion though. It smelled so sweet and delicious. ;_;


**TonyMoly**

Also went to the new TonyMoly store on 32nd. I couldn't stay in that booger sized store for too long. Hella marked up too. Homegurl ain't paying no $15 for a bunny gloss.",4189,789,asian_beauty

I really want to give asian bb creams a try. Specifically the brand Missha since I've seen so many people on this sub rave about their bb creams. The thing is I suuuuck at matching myself with products. Took me forever to find the shades that fit me.
Anywho, below I put the foundations I use to give an idea of my skin shade. Can you help me narrow down the shades I should look at and which of the Missha BB creams I should try? That way I will only have to hunt down a few samples.


 [Foundations I use:](http://findation.com/searches/745635)
 
* Revlon Colorstay Whipped Creme Foundation - True Beige
* Urban Decay Naked Skin - 6.0
* CoverGirl Outlast Stay Fabulous Foundation 3 in 1 - Golden Tan 857

upoppinmystones,"[Haul] From Chinatown, Manhattan. First timer, and noob questions - Hey, I've been reading this sub for a while and really helped me prepare for a routine so now I finally went out and I think I have everything I want now except for an eye cream.  I bought toner and a bunch of sheetmasks/miscellaneous stuff from the new Tony Moly in Koreatown a few weeks ago but now I had the time and money to get a whole set!  

My noob question is for any of the real water-y substances, like essence:  I apply it with a cotton pad like toner right?  I'm just worried there might be a more efficient way to deliver product to my face vs sucked up in the cotton pad.  Also when is the best time to exfoliate, after cleanser but before toner?  I've seen some sites recommend after toner but that seems really weird/dumb to me.

Here's my haul from [oo35mm](http://i.imgur.com/I57VDZn.jpg) where the girl in the store was really helpful to me and recommended both the Cure and the Cleansing Water (which I love and never would have picked up myself!)  And then where I dropped mad money at [The Face Shop,](http://i.imgur.com/1LwaETO.jpg) which was wayyyyyy bigger than I was expecting for a Chinatown store.

faceturtle,"[Question] PLEASE help! What ingredient(s) in Mizon's snail ampoule could be giving me blackheads, and what could be a good replacement for increasing collagen and elastin production? - I was so super excited for [this ampoule](http://www.skinandtonics.com/mizon-snail-repair-intensive-ampoule-review/), especially after Skin and Tonics' awesome review (I LOVE how she breaks down the ingredients). I was definitely looking for a product to boost collagen and elastin production, and originally I was a little sceptical about the Snail Mucin part of this product, but it proved to be awesome almost immediately. I had the flu for a week, and my nose was red, raw and dry from blowing my nose every two seconds, so I thought what the hey and slathered it in the Mizon ampoule before bed (The whole point of snail mucin is that it's repairing right?). I woke up in the morning and, although my skin was still a little dry and flaky, it had healed SO much! I wish I'd taken pictures, it was that amazing. With a squeal of excitement I started using the product as part of my routine day and night, super excited to rub all the benefits into my skin, thinking I had found a serious holy grail - Then I started getting blackheads. I hardly EVER get blackheads normally, I get closed comedones instead, but suddenly I was getting roughly 10-20 blackheads on my face at a time, some on my forehead and some on my chin. Unfortunately, the ampoule had to stop =(

SO, in terms of this product's ingredients, what could be causing the blackheads? And what other products are out there with Pentapeptide-4, Copper Tripeptide-1 and Human Ogliopeptide-1? Or a similar list packed with awesome ingredients for collagen and elastin production?

Here's a full list of the ingredients:

Snail Secretion Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycereth-26, Punica Granatum Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Trehalose, Copper Tripeptide-1, Human Ogliopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Cornus Officinalis Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Caprylyl Glyocol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tropolone, Sodium Polyacrylate, Adenosine, Coptis Japonica Extract, Disodium EDTA

[deleted],"24k Active Gold Liyanshiji Blackhead Removal Nose Mask..... Holy smokes this is excellent! - So I received a packet of this from my friend in Saudi Arabia in a package swap we did. It says it's a nose mask but each packet is a one-time use packet with more than enough product for the whole face. It smells kind of medicinal but wooooooooooow it works SO well.

When I first opened it I was expecting a nose sheet (the photo on the packet makes it look like a sheet you drape over your nose) but it's actually a thick, white mask that you spread on your face. It has a strange texture, also. Kind of tacky and sticky. When I tried to wash the excess off of my finger it was really sticky and became slimy when it was wet so it took a bit of soap scrubbing to get it off.

It doesn't smell particularly good and I can't read the ingredients list so I'm not too certain what's in it exactly. As far as I can tell it's from Malaysia, maybe... Has anyone else heard of this product? 

In any case, it worked SO well. My nose seemed so much clearer and my cheeks too! I don't usually get a ton of blackheads but I did have some on my nose before using this mask and after letting it sit for 20 minutes I pulled off a crapton of disgusting blackheads I didn't even know existed. It was slightly painful to pull off the mask, but not too bad. I washed the residue off with a warm washcloth and already my skin seemed clearer.

I found them for sale [here](http://www.lelong.com.my/24k-active-gold-liyanshijia-black-head-removal-nose-mask-10-pcs-truebox-I1675565B-2007-01-Sale-I.htm) and you get 10 for $4.52 USD. Not a bad deal at all.

Wanted to get the AHA&amp;BHA toner too but looks like it might have been discontinued (disappeared from Mizon's toner/lotion bestseller list). So only managed to get:

* Acence Derma Clearing Toner - Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Glycolic Acid
* AHA 8% Peeling Serum - Glycolic Acid
* Pore Control Peeling Toner - Glycolic Acid, Salicylic Acid

[Results](http://i.imgur.com/p5PLmJi.jpg)

Which means:

* AHA 8% Serum passes.
* Pore Control Toner just about passes, might be too mild for those used to chemical exfoiliants.
* Derma Clearing Toner probably a waste of effort.

[EDIT] Wall of science text

*Cosmetic Ingredient Review;Final Report on the Safety Assessment of Glycolic Acid, Ammonium, Calcium, Potassium, and Sodium Glycolates, Methyl, Ethyl, Propyl, and Butyl Glycolates, and Lactic Acid, Ammonium, Calcium, Potassiam, Sodium, and TEA-Lactates, Methyl, Ethyl, Isopropyl, and Butyl Lactate, and Lauryl, Myristyl, and Cetyl Lactates; Journal of American College of Toxicology 17(Suppl 1):1-242 (1998).*

&gt;Dermal effects of glycolic acid application in conjuction with pH were investigated. First, the dansyl chloride method was used to monitor changes in rates of normal skin cell renewal as a result of twice daily application of glycolic acid. **As pH increased, the stimulation of cell renewal decreased; at a pH of 6, very little stimulation was observed**. The relationship between irritation, renewal, and pH was then examined using 4% glycolic acid, with skin irritation being evaluated clinically by subjective assessment of stinging in the nasal fold area on a scale of I -5 and with the Minolta Chroma Meter, which measured changes in skin redness. A strong correlation between irritation and stimulation was observed. At pH 3, irritation and cell renewal were scored as 2.9 and 34%, respectively. At pHs of 5 and 7, irritation/cell renewal were scored as 2.1/23% and 1.1/10%, respectively. The stimulation of skin renewal by 3% glycolic acid, pH 3, in subjects never exposed to AHAs or exfoliant treatment over an extended period of time was also investigated. **After 10 weeks of applications, cell renewal diminished by approximately 43%. After 20 weeks of applications, cell renewal diminished by approximately 60%**. Similar results were obtained upon measurement of the rate of cell shedding. A baseline of 1 was used for test and control subjects. After 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, the percent change in cell sloughing due to continued application of 3% glycolic acid, pH 3, was 2.21 , 2.08, 1.73, 1.36, and 1.15, respectively, as compared to control values of 1.08, 0.95, 1.17, 1.06, and 1.11, respectively. The difference between treated and control values at week 12 was not significantly different.

**TL:DR AHAs will ""work"" even up to pH 7, just expect minimal improvements and looks like their effects will diminish over time**

Only other problem is that I can't find any information on the percentage of AHA/BHA in the toners or even a ppm to work it out from. They're a bit like EU companies where they don't really list the percentages of active ingredients unless it's a selling point.

ka_hime,"Review: Skin79's Sweet Honey Sugar Scrub (x-post from Korean Beauty) - So I got this from Pretty&amp;Cute's actual store located in Portland, OR a few months ago... I know a lot of you think P&amp;C is expensive and well, they are. But! A cool thing that they have is a damaged section where you can get $5+ off a product because the box has been dented. Not bad, eh!?

Anyways! This scrub is really nice and pretty comparable to SkinFood's Black Sugar Scrub in the way that you can see and feel results when you wash it off. The main difference is that this one melts a lot faster, so there's less of a scrub to get rid of the flakes. When I have super dry skin I notice it takes me a few uses to get all of it off (Over time but this is a rare thing) versus AmorePacific's Enzyme Treatment or SkinFood which can remove it all in one swoop! So if you have severely dry skin with lots of flakes this may not be the one for you or realize this will take a few uses for results to show. The sugar granules are also a lot smaller so it doesn't feel like a harsh scrub on your face, but instead a nice massage. It's gentle enough to use on your body and works amazingly well for your feet! I've been using it on my feet to get sandal ready and they're so super soft now  :3

I feel like my skin is definitely a lot brighter and softer after the very first time I used it and still continues to show me soft, bright skin almost three months later, which means I will definitely come back and repurchase when I run out!

I also have sebaceous filaments, slightly enlarged pores, get flushed easily, and a bit of PIH on my chin.  I live in Texas so it gets very hot and a bit humid in the summer.  



Currently using Perricone MD Face Finishing Moisturizer which is nearly empty and I'm not in a place to drop another $60 on moisturizer right now.  My other products (besides the Perricone) consist of:



* Holika Holika Soda Pore Deep Cleansing Oil

* Face Shop Rice Water cleansing foam

* Missha First Treatment Essence

* Benton Snail Bee Essence



I am waiting on a shipment with the OST Vitamin C Serum which I'll also be incorporating.  Also, I only use the cleansing oil when I wear makeup which is maybe once a week.



I have a tub of Its Skin Moisture Gel and I'm not really a fan.  I don't feel like it is very moisturizing and it seems like it just leaves a shiny film on my face.



One thing I like about the Perricone is my face is hydrated but not oily in the morning.  I work from home so most days during the week I will just splash my face with water in the morning and be good for the day. I have anti-aging and brightness concerns so anything that helps those is welcome.

electricpixies,"BB cream recommendations for oily, acne-prone skin? - Hi! I've been having trouble finding a good base for my oily, acne-prone skin. I also have enlarged pores, but I was told that primer would take care of that. My skin tone leans towards medium-tan with yellow/neutral undertones.

Simply put, I *haaate* wearing foundation. Hate hate hate it. Powder and liquid foundations can get really cakey on me, and they melt from my face within like ten minutes from application because I live in a very humid country and get sweaty very easily. All I ask for is a lightweight, medium-coverage base that should even out my skin tone and not make me feel like a cakeface. I was told that a good BB cream might work, so here I am. 

Sadly, I don't have access to Missha &amp; Skin79 (which seem like some of the most popular brands around here), but I live near a mall which has Etude House, The Face Shop, and Nature Republic.

luminous_delusions,"Looking for an alcohol-free (or low) sunscreen. Preferably physical, but combo is okay too. - I have a love/hate relationship with my Neutrogena Dry Touch sunscreen and I'm desperately looking for a new one. Dry Touch looks awesome under my makeup, but the chemical factor kind of serves to make my skin/face heat up a lot in the sun and the alcohol can increase the dryness of my skin. Basically, it gets the job done, but it's not that great.

I've tried a lot of US available sunscreens and I don't really care for any of them. They either look awful under makeup, dry me out ferociously, or are grease balls. So, I'm looking towards Asian brands since they seem to have their shit together on SPF, but have no idea what might work for me. I'm still very new to Asian skincare and most of the other posts on SPF I'm seeing here are people looking for ones *without* any white cast, have oily skin, and don't care about alcohol content. I'm the opposite; I don't mind a white cast (and it actually might benefit me and my pale skin), have dry skin, and need at least low alcohol so my face doesn't get dried out more.No super noticeable sunscreen scent would be awesome too, but is definitely not required. 

I'd like to avoid purely chemical sunscreens as I hate the way they trap heat in my skin (and thus result in tomato face for me).

i just want everyone to learn from my mistake. ONE new product at once! *seriously.* :)


--------


**EDIT: follow up!**
i've been doing some furious research and cross-checking all of the ingredients in a lot of the new products i've used.
i *believe* it may be a bad reaction to an ingredient called cyclopentasiloxane, which is a silicone. it was in my dr. jart+ melting cream, which is what i suspected to be the culprit. 

skin and tonics, which is basically my encyclopedia regarding skincare, notes a bad cystic acne reaction to [mizon snail gel cream](http://www.skinandtonics.com/mizon-snail-recovery-gel-cream-review/), and attributes it to this silicone. [makeupalley](http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp?ItemId=144672) has a few reviews describing reactions to this as well which mirror what happened to my face, in terms of type of acne and also placement.

obviously, a caveat: everyone's skin is different and not everyone will have a reaction to cyclopentasiloxane, but i thought i'd add this information in case anyone was using a product with this ingredient and wondering why their face looked like a damn pizza.

sphluh,"[Rave] TheFaceShop Melting Cleanser (Oil, Detergent, Paraben, Artificial Coloring, Animal Source Ingredients free) - I just wanted to share one of my favorite makeup removing cleansers from the Faceshop. I've tried many western (Dior, NUDE, Ren, Lancome, MUFE, Fresh, Paula's Choice) and eastern (Kose, Shiseido, Sana, DHC, Shu Uemura) brands and this one is definitely one of the best in terms of effectiveness and gentleness.

What I usually find in most cleansers one quality compromises the other, so the really effective ones are not so gentle, and the gentle ones are not so effective so what's really great about this cleanser is that it feels like nothing at all yet is able to remove most makeup effectively (the exception is eye and lip stuff designed to be super long lasting but ideally you should have a separate eye and lip remover for this anyways as these two areas are special) 

It is a lightweight gel that you apply to your face, let sit for 30 seconds and then you massage off your makeup, it rinses off completely clean and you don't feel any residue whatsoever. Just to be safe I also use Cerave's foaming cleanser afterwards in order to ensure my face is super duper clean. Another great thing about this cleanser is if you tightline you can get it into your eyes and between your eyelashes without worrying about discomfort.

I'm including some pictures below to show it in action.

**Packaging:**

It comes out of a pump bottle which contains 5.07 fl oz of cleanser, I used mine almost everyday and it lasted me for 4 months.

I've been buying primers from Sephora because they're so important.. especially for a combination skin like mine.. 
but recently, I've been spending more money on sunscreens, finishing powders, bronzers, etc so I'm trying to save money on other products like eyeliners, mascaras and primers 

I've been reading blogs and reviews, but most Korean people tend to use primers for he purpose of concealing pores... but my purpose is extending the length of wear of my foundation and giving better adherence to it.. 
I'm thinking of Innisfree no sebum primer, VDL beauty finisher, Banila co matte primer, and the face shop velvet skin

Meh-_-,"Going to buy new products soon, but having trouble deciding which - Firstly, I'm well aware that I need to slowly introduce new products into my regimen, and I will.

I want to get into an Asian skincare routine, but in reading everything, I've become overwhelmed and thoroughly confused. I would really appreciate some help in figuring these things out.

Skin: pale (cannot tan), freckles, normal, sensitive, breakouts are practically nonexistent

Goals: aging-deterrent, theoretically primarily through moisturizing and protection; fading freckles; preferably $20 or less each

I have a cleanser that I use and like, and currently use the Hada Labo lotion for my toner. When I bother with it, my ""sleeping pack"" of choice is coconut oil. I currently use Dolphin Organics mineral sunscreen, but would like to switch to something else for my facial sunscreen.

I **do not** want anything with snail slime or bee venom in it, please. I know it's popular here, but I'd like to avoid them. If anything I have listed has these ingredients in it, please let me know.

These are a few of the recommendations I've seen here, but *more suggestions are absolutely welcome!*

**Essence:**  
Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Moist Essence EX  
Missha First Treatment Essence  
SkinFood Watery Berry Serum  
JuJu Aquamoist Essence  
Hada Labo Shiroshizuku Whitening Serum

**Emulsion:**  
Hada Labo Snowy White Emulsion (I can't find this actually listed anywhere)  
JuJu Aquamoist Whitening Milk
SkinFood Royal Honey Emulsion

**Cream:**  
Dear by Enprani Bounce Cheese Cream  
Biafine  
Hanyul Rich Effect Revitalizing Cream  
Etude House Dear Darling Cream  
SkinFood Steam Milk Mask Cream

**Sunscreen:**  
There are many suggestions here that I could list, but every one I've seen is PA+++.  
I would like spf 50+ PA++++, preferably mineral-only, but I will consider mixed; and I would like it to be lightweight and quickly ""dry"" to the touch (my current one feels a bit oily for quite a while after I put it on, and the texture doesn't leave much to be desired in general).",2066,332,asian_beauty
SqueekyTabs,"Sunscreen Strong Enough For Camping? - I am going to be going camping for about a week at the end of July this year in Ontario. I have yet to get a sunscreen for my routine. I have been looking at two but have no idea if they would be strong enough for camping. We would be out in the boat fishing probably everyday and swimming and just walking around.

The two that I was looking at are:

Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++

Biore UV Perfect Face Milk SPF50+ PA+++ (can't find the new formulation with the 4 + online.)

Are these strong enough? Or do I need something much stronger for camping? If I need something stronger I will probably still get these to try for everyday use minus camping.

I also wouldn't know how much or how often to apply/re-apply the sunscreen. So I would love to hear everyone's recommendations. I don't see myself wearing makeup while camping, so I don't need to worry about it sitting well under a full face of makeup. I will probably have bare arms, legs, face, and chest (wearing tank tops and bathing suits). So I would be applying it in many places so if there is a good sized bottle and a decent price that would be great. 

Do I use two different sunscreens? One for body and one specifically for face?

cococolon,"question about 2 products, and some skinfood and Ohui products - It's a day of full size freebies for me. :D

I received a swag bag with two serums from a skincare treatment center that just opened in Hong Kong, I doubt anyone has heard this brand before (""Cospeutic""), but I'm interested to know if the products are good on paper at least!

1. Hyaluronic Acid:

ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium hyaluronate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lecithin, Alcohol denat, Methylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethyparaben

2. B5 Hydrating Essence:

ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Pheynoxyethanol, Panthenol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lecithin, Alcohol denat, Methyparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaebn, Ethyparaben

It seems a little odd because the two products have practically identical ingredients list save for Panthenol/Sodium hyaluronate (and that's 4th on the list). I haven't used a hyaluronic acid or b5 essence before, so if anyone has experience in either from different brands, would love to know how it worked out for you. 

I have acne prone oily but also dry at times skin. 

Oh, and a friend went to Korea and bought me some random products, any experiences with these?

AiyZ,"Questions about PIH/my routine - So since I adapted an asian skincare routine I've managed to completely clear my skin(I never had an extreme amount of pimples anyway) but to me even 1 pimple is a lot. I didn't start getting pimples till I was about 14. I get a pimple or two from time to time as having completely clear skin in my teenage years with stress etc(im only 17) would be a miracle. So I have some PIH on my cheeks because I'm silly and picked at them and one or two marks on my chin. Right now PIH and a couple of blackheads on my nose area are my concern. After that, I think I might be really content with my skin. Although just getting perfect translucent,no marks/redness or freckles is a hell of maintenance.(This is my goal)Want help to achieve this :)
This is my routine at the moment

**Oil cleanser**(use baby oil)

**Foaming cleanser**(missha creamy latte green tea)

**Exfoliator** (Right so this might sound weird but I have a decent amount of peach fuzz on my face and so I shave it off, I have reasons to do this but anyway because of this I exfoliate once a week mostly. Using skinfood black sugar scrub. 

**Toner**(etude house wonder pore)

**Essence**(I've ordered samples and I'm trying to decide what I want, going for missha time revolution, but I'm not sure yet)

**Ampule**(Miisha time revolution)

**Masks**(I use them a couple times a week, don't buy really expensive ones, just cheap natural sheet masks) I use innisfree pore clay mask and some others I have but only once a few weeks for them.

**Eye cream**(Really need one, I know eyes starting aging first, if anyone has any good suggestions please say!)

**Emulsion**(Etude house collagen emulsion)

**Special care** (tosowoong intensive whitening cream)

So this is it, I have sensitive and oily skin. I did try a bha for marks and my sensitive skin freaked out/dried out. It didn't like it all. I use spf 30-50 everyday. I have ordered the mizon aha because aha is better for sensitive skin. Thats what I have in plan for the PIH but if you have any suggestions or advice please!

pinay53,"A list of the darkest korean bb creams :) - So for all my lovely tan makeup lovers, you know how hard it can be trying to find an Asian bb cream that matches our skin tone.  For reference I'm about an NC40, and I thought it would be helpful to list some of the bb creams I've tried or heard of!


Missha Perfect Cover #31 Golden Beige: Most of you have probably heard of this one and it's been my holy grail for the last 4 years.  The color match is perfect, it covers my acne scars well, and controls my oils...basically just magic in a tube.


Skin79 Bronze Super Plus Beblesh Balm: This one came out pretty recently and I excitedly bought a few samples cheap off prettyandcute.  Honestly I was pretty disappointed with this one.  Surprisingly this was actually a bit dark for my face (note: I did test this out during the Winter time).  It was also really dewy and didn't seem to cover my acne scars that well.  Overall I'd recommend this to someone maybe NC42 with decent skin looking for something moisturizing.


Etude House Precious Mineral BB Bright Fit W15 Sand Beige: Geez that's a long name lol.  Don't be confused with the numbering as W15 is the darkest shade and W24 is the lighter shade before it.  I saw a youtuber (dolledupbysamantha) who looked about my shade review this so I bought it right away.  Even though it came out pretty dark, once it dried it was about a shade too light for me.  Maybe this would work better for an NC35?  Pretty sad too since it covered my scars well and my skin felt amazingly soft when I washed it off at the end of the day.


Skinfood Peach Sake Pore BB #4-8:  Unfortunately I haven't tried this one out yet.  The darker shades are a bit harder to find and the only place I know where to buy it online is on urbanoutfitters.  The downside is the darker shades don't contain any spf.  Urbanoutfitters also marks the price up pretty high with their shipping and for some reason they don't sell shade 3? lol


Laneige BB cushion dark: Sorry guys haven't tried this one either.  Sigh the problems of being a broke college student lol.  As far as I know this shade is only sold in Target or on the Target website.  The benefit is that it comes with a refill which could help justify the price.  It looks pretty promising with the spf and it seems like a great option for us tan girls who are dying to try the wonders of a bb cushion :)



A word of advice: if any of you guys find yourself left with a bb or cc cream too light for your skin you could always set it with a powder darker than the natural shade of your face.  It helps to even out the white cast and prevent your bb/cc from feeling lonesome at the bottom of your drawer :P

For a more detailed review, check it out [here!](http://linlinhime.blogspot.com/2014/05/review-clio-lipnicure.html)

**Pros:**

* Easy to Apply
* Wide Range of Colors
* Long Lasting
* Matte Finish
* Water proof
* Touch Proof
* Super Pigmented


**Cons:**

* Needs to fully set for 30-60 seconds
* Can get gummy after oily foods or alcohol
* Requires it's own remover
* Can only be used with a Clio gloss
* Exfoliation needs to be done first before wearing

**Rating:** 6/10

I know there are a lot of cons to even get this high of a rating I realize that, but there are also quite a few pros to these babies as well. I find that sometimes I have to wait even longer for some colors to dry (Darker ones seem to take a while to dry) which can be super frustrating when all I want is a super pretty lip color and to run out the door! But like I said, once these are dry and on they stay PUT and I don't have to retouch until I remove it later at night... Which is what we all want, right!?

I do recommend Guilty Pink most definitely as it's just a gorgeous girly pink and would work super well on any lip color as well as Tension Red (it's the perfect blue-red color) and Rumor Coral (Hello MAC M'Orange dupe?!). They're just so vibrant and beautiful on!",1665,311,asian_beauty

I have large pores and oily skin (and some acne, blackheads and sebaceous filaments) so I'd like to fix up my skin.

Any help is appreciated!

lilteapot,"Halp, Memorial Day Sunburn - I forgot to reapply sunscreen on my face, so I got a twinge sunburned. When I get sunburned on my face, my face swells a little. Last night, I iced the hell out of my face by putting some ice and cold water in a ziploc bag and then putting a wet towel over my face with the filled ziploc bag on top. Then I threw some tea bags in water and used the tea bags on my eyelids and soaking the towel in the tea to put over my face. Repeat a couple times.

Morning after, swelling has gone down significantly, but still some residual puffiness with some redness. What's the next step? I know my skin is going to probably majorly dry out soon so that the dead skin will flake off. Do I continue what I did last night, or what?

* Philosophy's Help Me retinol treatment and Clarin's Lotus oil every evening. I use them to fight PIH, breakouts and oiliness 
* I also use Clean and Clear's BP during that time of the month as well to fight break outs o

I really like those products, but I'm just not sure how I would work them in according to the ~11-step (less for me) skin care routine. 

My routine is as follows

* **Oil cleanser** The Faceshop Rice Water Bright Light Oil
* **Cleanser** CeraVe Foaming cleanser (with a Clarisonic on days I don't use AHA)
* **Toner** I have the Habo Labo lotion original and Neostrata 8% AHA toner, so idk which one I should use first 
* **Essence/Serum** I'm just finishing up my Origins Mega Bright Serum, and will replacing it with the Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence. 
* **Moisturize** Will be using Benton Steam Cream evening only. I have oily skin so I don't like to do emulsion and cream.
* **Sunscreen** Roc Velvet Matte Sunscreen

I am half korean and half white. I'm really struggling with my brows. I own Benefit Brow Zing in medium and dark and I apply with an angled eyeliner brush, but it always ends up too obviously dark and drawn on and the browns are too warm for my hair color which is more cool-brown. The wax also never stayed put on the tails of my brows, it would smudge a lot or wipe off. 

Someone gifted me the Lioele Auto Eyebrow pencil in Dark Brown and I LOVE how the color matches my hair and how it's not too dark/heavy, but I can't get precise lines with it on the edges of my brows and the tails. I would love to know if there is something like this which is similar in color to the Lioele pencil. I live next door to The Face Shop so anything I could get there would be great!

Also, my brow hairs grow sideways where they start. I would like to get brows like these [here](https://24.media.tumblr.com/5eed198d2d107414fc96af56cda49474/tumblr_n0mevuMUIe1qhpc39o1_400.jpg), where the inner corner is softer and less blunt and squared off (like mine), but the brow hairs always grow up looking straight and perfect.

[deleted],"Hi! I'm new and could use some product suggestions for a routine! (combo skin) - So my current routine is super minimal because the less I do the less chance I have of screwing with my skin. I  Blemishes, dullness, and preventative wrinkles are my biggest concerns. I tan easily and have a medium to tan skin tone. It ranges from ~NC30-40, probably. My skin is combo-dry in the winter and combo-oily in the summer!

I have an oil cleanser that I like! I am overwhelmed by softeners, essence/serum, emulsions and sunscreen, though! I'm guessing that it depends on what I want them to do with my skin. As the weather is getting warmer where I live, my skin is beginning to tend combination/oily. Therefore, I'd like recommendations on products that target blemishes, dullness/uneven skin tone.  I'd like to incorporate an AHA, as I tend toward blackheads and clogged/large pores. I'd also love light moisturizer and sunscreen recs, as most things I've tried weigh down my face.

If it's relevant at all, I don't wear concealer or foundation.  

Thank you so much! I'm so overwhelmed. My skin is actually pretty nice (compared to my high school days...), but it's about time I start treating it nicely instead of as an afterthought.

novembertwelfth,"Korean Haul and Swatches - Hey all! I went to Seoul for 4 days and spent half a day buying makeup. I already have a sweet skincare routine thanks to /r/skincareaddiction, so I wasn't interested in getting any skincare items. Just makeup and hair products! Of course I ended up getting skincare samples. And I bought some snail mucus products for my mom. She loves the stuff. I didn't have lip products in my collection, so that was my main focus. I *thought* I had enough eye shadow, but apparently I was wrong.

[Here's the album](http://imgur.com/a/31HQR)

Anyway! There's quite a few lip products. Some concealers and pale BBs,  eye shadows, and a blush. Products from Etude House, Tony Moly, Missha, Nature Republic, Skin79, and 3 Concept Eyes. I did go in Too Cool for School, Holika Holika, It's Skin, Clio, and many others. But by that time I was shopped out and didn't really feel the need for anything else.

The Imgur album has captions, so I'll try not to repeat myself too much :-P

**Some first impressions:**

* Skin79 BB Green Bottle: I already loved my Missha M Perfect Cover #13, but I saw /u/carlycupcake's post a few days ago and wanted to try the Skin79 Green. I wore it today for the first time (applied with a damp beauty sponge) and it looks great! 14 hours later and it still looks even, with barely any settling into my laugh lines (I could only see it 3 inches from the mirror as I pursed my lips to the side. Much less settling than Missha or Nars Sheer Glow).

* Lip Products: I was a little disappointed that none are very moisturizing. Not even that Tony Moly cherry mini lip balm. The Nature Republic Angel Lip Balm feels good at first, until it wears off and leaves your lips a hotpink desert. My favorite formula right now is the Etude House Dear My Blooming lips, which I wore to work today. The Tony Moly Delight Bam Bam Tint is so weird. The lip color side is dry, and when you go over it with the balm the pigment gets pushed around unevenly and looks really bad. It looks great on my wrist, but I can't make it work on my lips. Any hints? The lip concealer is more watery than I expected, so the coverage isn't very strong. I don't notice a big difference with or without it. I haven't have enough time to thoroughly test the other lips products.

* Etude pressed powder eye shadows: Obviously shimmery, but there's no fallout if you apply carefully. (Even thought it's a powder, it's a bit cohesive and the powder sticks to itself, if that makes any sense). I really love the colors! Especially the Swing Red Ring.

* 3 Concept Eyes: The blush looks lovely, and I wanted a lavender blush in my collection. I didn't need the pink side, but the lavender wasn't sold as a single. The blended swatch looks much more pigmented in real life. I sought out this makeup counter in Lotte (a department store) after reading /u/phlee921's Korean Product Guide in the sidebar. She said it's popular among college-aged girls. When I found the counter, there was a swarm of ladies around it. When I finally found room to approach and begin swatching, people began pushing in, and one lady literally shoved me aside! There were 2 frantic clerks trying to help everyone. And customers would grab a tester, and start waving it in the clerks face while shouting ""Sorry! Sorry! Excuse me! Can I have this please!"" even though the clerk was obviously busy helping another customer. It was a madhouse. I chose my blush and got the heck outta there!

**Random Observations about Seoul**


When you enter a makeup shop, a clerk comes to you and *never leaves your side*. They told me what everything was that was in front of me, even though the labels were in English. I tested a clerk's dedication one time by powerwalking from one corner of a shop to the other, and the clerk still follow me, haha.

In every shop I entered, I asked my assigned clerk if they preferred communicating in Japanese or English. They all preferred Japanese.",3952,712,asian_beauty

skinandtonics,"PSA: Fellow beauty bloggers, please watch your Twitter accounts. Mine was stolen today, and it sucks. - My Skin &amp; Tonics Twitter account (@skin_and_tonics) was completely hijacked from me last night. My password was serious business - it was long, it did not spell any words, it included numbers, capital and lowercase letters, and a special character. Yet, someone - I honestly can't tell if it's a real person or an angsty teen spambot - still managed to completely take it over. They were thorough enough to change the email address as well, so there was no resetting the account. 

I urge all of my fellow beauty bloggers to change your Twitter passwords as soon as you can. I read somewhere that Twitter was unaffected by Heartbleed, and other reports that said it was - I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that Twitter was compromised. It's better to be safe than sorry.

I have contacted Twitter support numerous times, and have heard nothing back from them. I did a little research, and it seems that when something like this happens, there is very little hope of getting your account back. Those that did get their accounts back had to wait for weeks. WEEKS! Can you imagine the damage that can be done in a matter of weeks?

I would also encourage you all to enable your SMS verification on your Twitter account. I deeply regret that I did not do it sooner. I had over 1500 followers, and now I am starting over from square one. Not only that, but that person/spambot tweeted so incessantly and at so many people, there's no telling who they've offended. In only a few hours, this person has managed to destroy a Twitter following I've spent years cultivating. Please, please do not let this happen to any of you. It feels terrible. 

If you were following me on my @skin_and_tonics account, please [**unfollow me**](https://twitter.com/skin_and_tonics). That account is no longer me.

BB Cream: I'm not sure about my shade, but I currently use Missha Perfect Cover 23 and I love the coverage and texture but it's abit too pink for my yellow skin tone. I've also tried Missha M Signature 23 (color is more suitable but too dewy) and Skinfood Peach Sake 2 (yellow tone but it's too dry and breaks me out). I'm hoping to get some recommendations or some feedback from the BB Cream I have in mind below! 

-Etude House Bright Fit BB Cream: I have  heard amazing reviews about this but would like to check on what would the appropriate shade be for me considering that I use Missha 23?

-Etude House Precious Minerals Any Cushion: Rather than BB cream, I'm also thinking of BB cushion as it's more convenient for touch ups at work, and I read good reviews about this as well! Anyone who has tried this before can advise me on the shade? Based on the swatches, I'm thinking of W24 or W13. I'm also open to recommendations for other BB cushions!

""14:23 29-Jan-2014	 Departure from outward office of exchange""

That was two weeks ago, and the EMS tracking hadn't been updated since. I checked USPS's tracker for the first time last night, but they say only that ""Origin Post is Preparing Shipment"" with no date or time. I called USPS today (and was on hold for 45 minutes, grr) and the lady said her screen said the same thing, but that there was a date of January 31st. She told me it meant that it hadn't left Korea, and suggested maybe my package was sitting on a plane somewhere, ready to fly to the US but possibly delayed due to bad weather and canceled/rerouted flights. Understandable, but, it would be nice to have more information!

I'm going to email RRS in a minute, to see if they have any more information or can contact Korean customs to see if it's still there. But, is there anything else I can or should do?

deniably,"Has anyone experienced a breakout from the Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Face Sunscreen? - Hello! Some context: I'm combination, acne-prone but have never really experienced breakouts from products before. My pimples usually surface due to emotions, the weather or my period. However, I used my mum's sunscreen yesterday as for some reason I just couldn't find mine, and I woke up with six or seven tiny pimples today. I know it has nothing to do with my current routine or products, so I'm fairly certain it was caused by the sunscreen. It may be because of my period as well, but it is irregular so I can never know when a breakout is related to that.

Since I'm going to buy a sunscreen later, I'd just like to know if anyone who's using the Biore sunscreen has broken out from it before. Thank you!

**EDIT**

Thanks for all the comments! Looks like some people do face breakouts because of this product even if it's awesome. I'm probably going to purchase this and do a test patch as it is one of the only few raved-about sunscreen that's not going to break the bank for a student's budget.

GracieInColor,"[REV] Lioele Dollish Veil Vita BB #2 Natural Green - Hey guys thought I would give a bit of a breakdown on my latest BB cream purchase. Sorry for no pictures! My camera is broken.


I purchased the Lioele Dollish Veil Vita BB #2 Natural Green from Roseroseshop.com for $11. 

 
 **The Color:** I was first attracted to this BB because of it's green tone and the fact that it was supposed to cancel out redness. When pumped out this BB is a pale seafoam green but after rubbing it for a minute it darkens to a pinker version of Missha Perfect Cover #21, once dried it is dead on for the Missha Perfect Cover #23.

Overall I found there to be little color adjustment...yes it changed from white to skintone when I rubbed it but it never ajusted to match my tone.
 Initially it applied quite evenly but once it had oxidized to it's darker color I began to see patches that I had missed and had to go back and add more BB cream to blend it out as the first application had turned powdery dry. After these two applications no redness peeked through and my skintone (color) did look completely even in color after it was blended. But to be honest it was like working with a cheap drugstore foundation: paint it on and then blend blend blend before it dries.

 **Texture:** The texture of the cream was like that of a light moisturizer, lighter than any other BB cream I have ever tried. Once applied I didn't feel it at all, which was pretty cool. So if you are looking for a light feeling foundation this might be a good product for you.

 **Smell** Smells strongly like Etude Precious Mineral Cotton Fit BB Cream. I walked into the bathroom an hour after applying it and the room still smelled like it. 

 **Wear** This BB cream has a medium coverage with a powder finish once dried. So the more you apply the more cakey/powdery your face will look.

 I would suggest wearing a filling/sillicon primer with it is as sank into every wrinkle and pore on my face. I am 24 and before applying this BB I didn't think I had any wrinkles on my face... but apparently I was wrong. After applying The Dollish Veil I saw that in fact I have crows feet around my eyes, laugh lines around my lips and a few Grand Canyons on my forehead. Every unevenness of my skin and bump on my face became glaringly obvious with this product. You would really need smooth flawless skin to pull this BB cream off.

Just to let you know how obvious it was: When I walked out of the bathroom to show my husband the first thing he said was ""You look 40""... fail :(

I didn't wear it on my face all day, but instead left it swatched on my wrist and hand all day and it lasted even after several handwashings. 

 **Overall** this product was a fail. Right now I'm a Missha #13-#21 in summer. It was way too pink and dark. I would not use even if it matched my skin tone as it makes my normal 24 year old skin look like my 50 something mother's. I think I might try and salvage it by using it for contouring? If not I'll pass it on to someone who might use it.

**tl;dr**If you are a Missha #23 in color with pink undertones and plump perfect skin. Who is looking for light feeling medium foundation that require some serious blending this is the product for you.",3227,607,asian_beauty

I noticed that my skin, especially on my chin, seemed to be getting worse.

My route was:

AM: Nothing, maybe a splash of luke warm water on my face and then make-up.

PM: Innisfree Apple Juicy Cleansing Oil on my dry face, rinsed off and followed by the Apple Juicy Liquid Foaming Cleanser

Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence and then Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel

Only after I took the Cleansing Oil out of my routine did I notice a big improvement in my acne. The Benton products are definitely helping my skin heal faster and look nicer now. At first I thought they weren't working at all but I think they just couldn't keep up with the effects of the Cleansing Oil.

I'm kind of confused. I looked online at reviews, and of course in this sub, and could not find a review or a complaint about getting broken out from this product. There are posts from users who said they have super sensitive skin and the cleansing oil was great for not just removing their make up, but helping their acne. I got deep and painful red zits and some weird fleshy colored bumps on my face while using the cleansing oil, even though I was double cleansing.

Even more odd, I looked up the ingredients of the Cleansing Oil and Liquid Foaming Cleanser in COSDNA out of curiosity and the Cleansing Oil seemed to score low on anything that would cause irritation or acne, but the Liquid Foaming Cleanser had several ingredients that rated high for acne or irritant!

I have very sensitive, Irish, pale skin, but would also get acne on my forehead and chin. I used to use LUSH on my face, but I would still get break outs on my forehead. After only a few days of switching to The Face Shop, I have significantly less breakouts especially on my forehead, and my skin is balancing out. 

Currently I use their Calming seed mild foam cleanser, or the Clean Face Acne Solution Foam Cleanser, depending on my stress and hormones.  Amazingly the Acne solution doesn't irritate my skin! It's one of the first!

Then the Clean Face Toner- Again, I reacted to the Aloe Nature Republic Toner, but this one feels so nice.

Then the Arsainte ECco-Therapy Crystal Water Clear Essence- Awesome- not sticky and whitening. I can definately see the results.

Then finally, if I feel I need more moisture, or at night I use the Calming Seed Skin- Resting Cream. 

Also if I have makeup on, I use Nature Republic's Chamomile Cleansing oil. No problems with reactions there either.

I used all of these through samples first. I would highly recommend The Face Shop if you have sensitive skin. I am slowly trying their other products, and so far I haven't reacted to anything! It's so rare for me to not react, that I am now a life long fan of their stuff.

mamobus,"REVIEW: The Face Shop Products! - alright! So if you are me, you are generally curious about the affordable prices of many Korean beauty products, but are afraid to buy because you like to try things out in person. By the way I‚Äôm xposting this to /r/asianbeauty. I don‚Äôt really review things often so sorry if I suck.


I ended up at the The Face Shop in the Eaton Centre and decided to try out some stuff. I‚Äôm moving soon so I‚Äôm in a bit of a finance pinch and I wanted some more affordable options for makeup. And all Korean makeup has the most adorable packaging, so there‚Äôs that.

http://imgur.com/a/wVDwF

So first, powder. I bought the Face It Radiance Powder Pact in spf50. My shade is NB21. I decided to go with this one versus the one with the blue lid for oily skin sort of on a whim (side note, the sales lady had no idea what she was talking about and not helpful), as my skin is sort of combination oily and not very oily. I really love the packaging. The outside ‚Äúface‚Äù of the product is shiny enough to be a mirror, and the mirror inside is sizeable enough. The closure is magnetic which feels sorta fancy and I like that. 

This product is definitely very heavy and powdery if applied with the sponge. Maybe it was my application though, because other reviews don‚Äôt think this? It‚Äôs also really drying if applied this way. The powder on my skin is basically translucent and blends very well. I like to ‚Äústamp‚Äù the product onto my t-zone with a brush, which gives me a much better finish that isn‚Äôt powdery. I wish the product didn‚Äôt feel so heavy, because otherwise I would love to apply it all over for the SPF. I‚Äôm also not a huge fan of the smell (or products with smell on whole). I tried it without foundation and it definitely has enough coverage for me to work as a foundation by itself. 

That being said, the product stays very well and ultimately does its job. I don‚Äôt know if I would repurchase it but I would like to try the other powders from the line. I mean I really wanted to like this product and ultimately I feel sorta ‚Äúmeh‚Äù about it. If you have oily skin or needed a lot of coverage this would probably be for you. I would really like to try out the loose powder and see if I like them better.

The blusher is called ‚ÄúLove me:ex Pastel Rose Cushion Blusher.‚Äù Rose is the colour, the other ones from the line are ‚Äúpeach cushion‚Äù or ‚Äúplum cushion.‚Äù The packaging is super cute; a mint green cardboard container with a super cute but useless powder puff (unless you like basically smacking your face with product). The product is in a metal pan so if you hate the package the blush would be super easy to depot. The colour of this is very pastel and light in comparison to what it looks like in the pot. I was originally worried that it wouldn‚Äôt show up on my face, but it‚Äôs actually a really nice, glowy pink. The product has a bit of shimmer but it doesn‚Äôt look shiny on my face. The staying powder is also very good on this product. The only issue is I am basically as pale as a vampire (a touch paler than NC15) so I worry about this product showing up on people with darker skin tones.

Love me:ex Style My Eyebrow pencil in what I‚Äôm 99% sure is 03 brown, but the English labelling was only on the outside shrink wrap packaging. Really love this pencil. I have fairly dark brows that I use Nars tinted brow gel in Pireaus to lightly fill gaps and keep them in place. I use a bit of pencil to shape them better. The pencil is a greyish brown as opposed to a reddish brown, stays really well and doesn‚Äôt deposit too much colour, which is perfect for me. It‚Äôs 3 bucks too so that price tag is fantastic. 

So overall, I like the makeup products for their staying powder but I think I need to shop around more to find formulations I like. The store was totally packed and I didn‚Äôt do as much research as I should have so I think I bought some stuff without really looking into it. I‚Äôd like to try the BB creams next and their skincare products seem pretty decent. Those reviews are on my post in Asian Beauty if you‚Äôre interested.

I also got a bunch of samples (so impressed with the sample selection) and the pomegranate sheet mask, the 3D ampule red ginseng and ceramide mask. The 3D aspect of the ampule mask basically meant it had a chin strap  and more folds to have it sit on your skin better, which I did like. I thought the mask was very moisturizing and I did wake up with almost tacky skin in the morning. My skin was super glowy though and I would repurchase. The pomegranate mask I‚Äôve seen others rave about and although I liked it while in use it broke me out :(. My boyfriend also got the volcano pore strip mask and didn‚Äôt notice a difference, unforuntately. I‚Äôm really excited to try more masks, sunscreen and the cleansing wipes (which seem very affordable!). Has anyone tried their cleansing balm?",4851,912,asian_beauty

dlitovich,"RRS Shipping/Tracking Question - Hi /r/AsianBeauty

The first order I placed with RRS was shipped a lot quicker than I thought it would, making me really want to use them for all my Asian beauty product purchases.  For my second order, I HAD to have the product (Benton Aloe BHA Toner) immediately so I paid for the most expensive/quickest shipping.  The problem is that the tracking number does not bring anything up and it has been two weeks, which is how long my previous order, with standard shipping, took.  I am probably being impatient but I just wanted to see if this was normal or not and if anyone had any insight that I am unaware of. 


Thanks!

Sharkus_Reincarnus,"[REV] Laneige Triple Sunscreen SPF 40 - I have a love/hate relationship with sunscreen. On the one hand, I know I need it. On the other hand, my experiences with sunscreens that have high enough protection for my tastes have been pretty bad. I'm happy to report that I really like this one!

For reference's sake, I'll be comparing this to the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch SPF 100, which the Laneige has replaced in my routine.

**First impressions**

Unfortunately, this is a tiny tiny bottle compared to what I'm used to. Thanks to the size and the rather high price ($25 online at Target), I'll only be using this on my face. I don't mind, since I have plenty of other Neutrogena sunblock to use everywhere else, but I thought I'd mention that.

**Application**

Holy white cast, Batman! The zinc oxide in this may be to blame for the *extreme* white cast that the product has when you first put it on. I'm diligent about applying the correct amount to my face, and doing so means that every morning, I reenact the scenes from *Memoirs of a Geisha* when they put on their thick white face makeup.

With that being said, the white cast does fade significantly after rubbing the product in and letting it absorb for about 15-20 minutes.

As far as texture goes, I really like it. It's thinner and more easy to spread on than the Neutrogena, which I found way too thick and stiff. I would still like a sunscreen that has a more liquidy or milky texture, but the Laneige is very serviceable. It also seems to absorb better than the Neutrogena, which I always felt left a very thick layer on my face.

**Results**

After applying the sunblock and allowing it to absorb for 15-20 minutes, it sinks in nicely and leaves a pleasant dewy glow. I didn't experience any excessive shine, and I only have to blot once or twice throughout the day. This is a huge improvement for me, since I generally had to blot the Neutrogena at least 4x/daily. A tiny bit of the white cast remains, but it isn't enough to be a problem. Instead, it contributes just a little whitening effect and coverage. I really appreciate this, since I don't wear face make-up besides loose translucent powder. I felt that it evened out the freckles on my cheeks a bit and gave a lovely finish.

**Final thoughts**

I love this stuff! I'm going to be ordering another bottle or two soon so that I won't run out unexpectedly. It is unfortunate that it costs so much for such a little amount, but it has met my sunblock needs much better than any other option I've tried, so it's worth it for me.

Finally--I ordered this on Target's website the day Laneige launched in the US. At the time, the website indicated that it's sold both online and in stores (about 700 stores nationwide, IIRC). Now Target's website shows that none of the Laneige products are available in-store. I wonder why this is and hope it isn't a bad sign for availability. Best case scenario is that it's simply sold out of all the stores it launched in, I guess.

Edit: It didn't break me out, but I don't feel qualified to make any statement about whether it causes pimples or not, because I don't usually get those anyway.",3159,570,asian_beauty

misandrycakes,"Questions about A'pieu Aqua Nature Deep Sea Dewdrop Cream, Hada Labo SHA Lotion toner, and super dry skin. - Does anybody have any experience with the A'pieu Aqua Nature Deep Sea Dewdrop Cream? I received a sample of it from a friend and dare I say I found it more moisturizing than the Benton Steam Cream? Like, Benton started out great but about a month in, it doesn't seem to moisturize as well as it used it. The A'pieu, however, felt really nice going on and felt like it moisturized really well only using a small amount and even more so when I topped it with a thin layer of Vaseline (like I always do even with Benton) and by morning, my skin felt very soft. I can't find any reviews on this though and since I only had a sample I couldn't test it past three nights.

On another note, I recently added the Hada Labo SHA lotion as my toner to see if that would help out with the dryness/dry patches I woke up with after using the Benton. I'm not sure how I feel about this? I followed the official instructional video and patting beyond the point where it started to feel slightly sticky and until it dried. Then another video says oh just stop patting until it's 70% dry. I don't even know if I am using it right.

I'm a makeup junkie that's curious about Asian skincare!

About my skin: I have ridiculously dry skin, especially now that it's winter. My cheeks have a bit of bumpiness going on and my nose is prone to flakiness. I don't get acne very often, but I get pretty darn stubborn and big pimples when it's ""that time of the month"" around my nose and chin. So on the spot acne treatment products would be appreciated. Also, I have uneven skin tone very similar to the before picture here http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2011-06-20-LETHA_before_after.jpg (lighter cheeks and darker around the mouth and chin). 

And this is a side question: are there gentle products that can gradually erase eyelid creases? Because I used to squint and rub my eyes constantly-- my eyelids are getting pretty wrinkly, even if I'm still young. It's not too big of a problem now but it makes makeup application rather annoying (making a straight eyeliner line doesn't work with all the folds) and I don't want super wrinkly eyelids in my 20's.

In short, I am looking for:

* **Hydration** (please! oh lawd)

* Uneven skin tone treatment

* Big pimple on-the-spot treatment

* Bumpiness and flaking

* An anti-wrinkle eye-cream (am I too young for this?)

* Nothing with harsh anti-aging products

The only thing I've previously ordered was some random things from sasa.com about 3 years ago(that I wasn't very impressed with) and the awesome mizon sail gel! I figured for an xmas present to me this year I'd get myself some things as the snail cream made a HUGE difference in my skin. 

1. **Mizon King to the Kong Toner and Step Up Cream** - I REALLY love this toner so far. I've only been using it for about two weeks, but this set smells delicious. My SO always comments on how good I smell after I put all my products on now! The toner is very light and it comes in a huge bottle. The gel is also nice too, it has the same fresh, light berry scent and it is a very light moisturizer. I got this for my mornings because I have oily skin and it reacted really well with the snail gel moisturizer. A little goes a long way and this will also last me forever. I really want the oil cleanser of this too, but I can't drop $30 yet after these two purchases. 

1. **Mizon Sail BB Cream and The Water Volume BB Cream** - I like both of these, but I like the Water cream better. It feels lighter on my skin, it def feels ""watery"". It spreads very nicely and it looks good with my super pale skin tone. The Mizon cream is a tad darker and it is thicker. It doesn't go on smoothly as the water cream, sometimes the snail bb will like, roll up? and make kinda granules? Not sure why that happens, but the Water Max is currently a def rebuy when I run out. 

1. **Missha 4D Mascara** - I really like this one a lot. I actually purchased 2 NYX mascaras a few days before and the missha blows them out of the water. Good coverage and it doesn't take a million coats. This will be a rebuy. 

1. **Sheet Masks** - Got a random assortment of brands since I haven't tried them before. I've tried the Innisfree Avacado and the Missha Honey. The avacado was nice, but I didn't notice a HUGE difference in skin tone, but my face was extremely moisturized and calmed. The honey one I feel like it def brightened my face. The innisfree mask was packed with way way more essence than the missha one. The innisfree was still very damp at the end of 30 mins, the missha one was almost dry. I also got some sleeping packs, but haven't used those yet. 

1. **Nail Polishes** - Some Toly Moly and Missha Polishes. I like them so far, the colors are pretty and the pigment is good, its not some crappy one that you have to paint 10 times to get the color to show and it not to streak. Would def buy more colors at the prices they go for. I also got the Missha Gel Dressing polish and I like that as well. If you want natural nails, two coats gives them that fake creamy look(I got the white). 

1. **Missha Serum Samples** - I can't really tell if these are doing anything yet. I am also maybe not using them right. I've just been picking one and using it. I got the marine stem cell, the time revolution, and the near skin radiance. They are all very thick and it took my skin a few days to get used to the extra stuff on my face. I use the whole packet, but maybe that's also too much? 

1. **Benton Snail Bee** - Everyone seems to love this stuff and since I got the mizon moisturizer, I was looking to insert the snails into another part of my regiment.  I have only used this stuff once(this morning), but I like how quickly it sinks in to my skin. With the missha serums, I always felt tacky for a bit after. Not the case with Benton, this sinks in quickly and a little goes a long way. I purchased the steam cream because I currently don't have anything thicker for the winter, only my gel moisturizers. 

1. **Toly Moly Cosmetics** - Wanted to get a cute hand moisturizer to keep in my purse and try the gloss bar and the catchu wink tint. Sadly, the wink tint bottle has been changed, it's just a regular heart top now. I bought it thinking it was still the adorable cat one. Makes me super sad, but I still really like the stuff. I got the delight color, it's a pretty cherry red. It's very matte though, so I top it with the Bunny Gloss Bar.

So far everything has been really helpful with my skin. I don't feel the need to wear foundation anymore, most of my redness is gone, my skin is moisturized and not flaky. Old acne spots are slowly fading. I'm quite impressed with asian cosmetics and I sing about them to everyone! One of my friends is going through shit with her skin, so I got her the trials of the benton products as well to see if that might make a difference.",4539,872,asian_beauty

[deleted],"Fake Missha from Roseroseshop? - Hi there, I'm generally lurking around here but I think it's my first time posting! Anyway, I ordered the Missha Perfect Cover in 13 from RoseRoseShop (on the ebay account, not the store) because I'd heard they were reliable, but I'm concerned I've gotten a fake. I need to take a closer look at the box (I threw it out, need to go dig it out for the bin) but I've swatched the 13 multiple times in store before and it's been much lighter and pinker than what came out of my tube- it's similar in colour to say, Skin79 Pink but more yellow. I didn't think much of it, and decided to wear it anyway, and my skin has begun to bubble and flake after a day of wear, and it's completely scaled up. I don't have sensitive skin usually, and I've never had this happen to me with a BB before.  Thoughts?  If I add a picture of my bottle can anyone help? 

I just want to know if I've actually got a fake or the product doesn't work for me because I was looking forward to using it and if it's fake I'd still like to locate a real one.

The only thing is, I've found every step I wanted try (and am fairly confident it'll work out with my skin) except for a foaming cleanser. I have dehydrated, oily, and acne-prone skin. I've been thinking about Etude House's Wonder Pore Whipping Foam cleanser, but I'm keeping my options open!
Do you guys have any foaming cleansers you love, or would recommend to someone like me?  
Thank you guys a bunch! :)",565,96,asian_beauty
noamountofcoffee,Monthly makeup box in Korea? - Does anyone know of a monthly makeup/products subscription (similar to Birchbox or Ipsy) that will ship to South Korea? Perhaps a Korean based company that I just don't know about yet? Thanks! :),226,39,asian_beauty
terribleatkaraoke,"I'd love to order from roseroseshop but.. - ..Their website is SO unfriendly! Is there a way to browse just lip tints, or masks etc? I don't know many good Asian brands so I'm just going through each and every page of each brand.. and there's like 80 pages or seemingly random product. The categories don't show everything they have, the search gives me different results every time and the sorting is just random. Do you girls know exactly what you want and just buy it, or is anyone else going through every single page?",522,95,asian_beauty
graciefatfacie,"What's your favorite Primer? - I've been looking for a good primer to use under my BB cream. So far all I've tried is the Etude House Baby Choux in red but it has a tendency to make my forehead look dry, even if I've moisturized. Have you ladies had any luck with other primers?",278,55,asian_beauty
minax128,"Where to get samples of Missha M Perfect Cover #27? - All I can ever find on websites that sell samples are #21 and #23 and those will be way too light on my skin. I searched on ebay and I only found travel/full size products but I'm not sure I want to commit to buying those before trying some out first.


I think the only place I've seen #27 samples are on the US website, but I'm in NZ and it doesn't offer international shipping. I know I can use shipping services like shipitto, etc but it's not worth it for a sample :( 

I'd be happy to pay for the samples and shipping if someone is willing to post them to NZ. Please PM me and we could maybe work something out :)",673,135,asian_beauty

[deleted],"Help finding Lip Water - I remember a post a while ago talking about Lip Water. However, I can find nothing about it on google, and Amazon had nothing either. It was lightly tinted and seemed like a good alternative to lip gloss. Am I getting the name wrong, or did I dream up this wonderful product? Thanks for your help!",322,61,asian_beauty
misandrycakes,[Haul] Roseroseshop and The Face Shop! - So I ended up in Chinatown NYC on Sunday and stopped by The Face Shop and picked up [a few things](http://i.imgur.com/28KLYHv.jpg). The Kose Softymo and the bubble net are from another store a few blocks away from TFS called oo35mm. Then my [Roseroseshop order] (http://i.imgur.com/uJg6E55.jpg) finally came in. I can't tell you who that guy they threw in as a freebie is but I'm excited about the sun milk sample since I've been on the hunt for a good suncreen!,503,87,asian_beauty
[deleted],"Hair Removal Products? [Korea] - Hi all!

I live in South Korea. I have an unfortunate problem with dark facial hair (despite having blonde hair....so annoying) but the hair removal products I'm used to from back home such as Nair are RIDICULOUSLY expensive here.

I speak passable Korean so I inquired at my local grocery store, but the ladies insisted that Korean girls don't use such products. I was not totally convinced; perhaps something was lost in translation.

**Does anyone know any decent hair removal products? I spotted one online from the Face Shop...but is it good? (the Face Shop Make Me Smooth in Shower Cream) if anyone has experience with it, please let me know! I'm searching for face AND body hair removal creams. Waxing is fine, too, but I prefer creams.**

If you know what these products are called in Korean, please let me know so I can search online and ask in-store myself. As of right now I don't know how to express it.

Thanks!",957,168,asian_beauty
